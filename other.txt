[Doctrine and Covenants 1:16] They don't wanna find God to build his justice...everybody just walks their own path, worships a fake god made from world vibes, built on lies. That idol? Crumbles in Babylon the Great… and it's about to fall flat.
[Doctrine and Covenants 1:17] God knew the chaos coming to Earth's crew, so he called up His man Joseph Smith Jr. and dropped straight commands from heaven. No fluff, just high-key divine texts.

[Doctrine and Covenants 1:36] And God's gonna drop full power over His saints, rule in their midst like a boss, then come down hard on Idumea...or the whole damn world. No fluff. Just judgment.

[Doctrine and Covenants 3:4] Even if a man gets way more revelations and power, if he flaunts his strength, ignores God's plans, and goes full self-will...boom. He falls. Just God. No mercy. Vibe check: self-love is a trap.
[Doctrine and Covenants 3:5] You got this power, but how strict was it? Remember...the promises? If you break 'em? No refunds. Full accountability.
[Doctrine and Covenants 3:6] And yet? You kept breaking God's rules, stuck in man-made lies. Full guilt ratio. Say less.

[Joseph Smith--History 1:20] Got double-dog dare from the divine dude: no more sects, all of 'em fake. Said I can't join any ... they're full of empty talk and man-made rules. When I snapped back to reality? Lying on my back, looking up at heaven. Light gone, body dead weight, but slowly got back up. Walked home, leaned by the fire, mom asked "what's up?" I said "Nah, all good ... I'm fine." Then told her: "I just learned Presbyterians? Total lie." Feels like evil knew early on I'd be that kid who keeps breakin' their world ... so they went full 'squad lockdown' on me from day one. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter personal revelation and cosmic resistance with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:21] A few days later I'm hangin' with a Methodist preacher full of hype and religious energy... start talkin' about my vision. He don't even react ... flat out mocks it, says "that's pure devil energy," claims no visions or revelations exist today, that the apostles shut it down forever. No more god stuff. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter rejection of modern prophecy with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:22] Soon realized my vision? Set off a full-blown religious hate wave. Even though I'm just a 14-15-year-old no-name kid with zero social clout, dudes in power started taking it personal and went full "this one's bad energy," sparking public attacks across all sects ... every single religion stacked up to hunt me down. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter widespread religious persecution with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:23] That moment hit me hard ... how the f*ck does a 14-year-old kid doing manual labor get labeled "threat level" by big-time religious leaders? All those popular sects go full 'hate mode' just 'cause I exist. No cap, it's wild. It still burns like a bad vibe in my chest every time I think about it. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter absurdity of targeted persecution with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:24] I saw a vision ... fact. Still, when I tried to explain it? Broke the internet. Some called me lying, others said I'm high, full meme energy. Got laughed at and pushed around like a glitch in the system. But still? That light and voice? Real as fuck. No one can erase that from my head. Even if they kill me, I know deep down: I saw it, heard it ... and no amount of hate or drama can make me doubt it. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter truth vs. mockery with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:25] I literally saw a light with two glowing dudes talking to me ... real deal. Even though they went full "you're the worst" and tried to tear me down for saying it? I just kept my head high. In my heart? "Why even hate me for telling truth? I've seen it, I know it, God knows it." They can scream all day, but I won't back down ... I'm not gonna lie or pretend I didn't see it. That vision? Non-negotiable. Denying it? That's where the offense starts. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter truth under attack with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:26] Finally locked in: no more joining any sects, just stay where I am 'til I get the next signal. Found James' testimony solid ... a guy with zero wisdom can still ask God for help and get it, without getting roasted. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter personal faith validation with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:27] Kept grindin' on my daily job through Sept 21, 1823 ... full-on hate from every corner: religious or not. Just kept saying "I saw a vision" and they went full 'cursed energy' mode. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter relentless persecution with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:28] From vision to '23? Left to fend for myself...no sects, no safety net, just pure youth energy. Persecuted by people who should've been my crew, kept gettin' swayed by bad vibes, stumbled into dumb moves and weak spots of teenage life. Not guilty of deep sins...never had that kind of dark intent...but yeah, I was full of levity, hangin' with loud, wild crowds, not in the mood for holy vibes. Still? My youth and cheery nature explain it. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter honest teenage flaws with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:29] After fumbling through weak moments and teenage messes? That night, I went straight to prayer...full apology mode. "God, forgive me for all the dumb moves, the bad vibes, the weakness… give me a clear sign so I know where I stand." Total confidence: I've had divine flashes before, so this time? No cap, I'm gettin' the truth. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter repentance and hunger for divine clarity with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:30] Mid-prayer, I suddenly see this light explode in my room ... brighter than noon, full sun vibes. Then? A figure pops up right beside my bed, floating in the air, feet nowhere near the floor. No cap. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter supernatural appearance with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:31] Wearing a robe so white? Like nothing in the real world, beyond any earthly glow. Full clean energy...arms, legs, feet, neck, head...all bare. Just that one open robe exposing his chest, no cover-ups. No cap, pure divine aesthetics. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter visual description of heavenly appearance with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:32] His robe? Flawless white ... more radiant than any earthly light. Entire body? Glorious, like a supernova. Face? Pure lightning energy. Room lit up, but the zone around him? Still darker, like a halo. First look? I froze, heart dropped… then the fear melted like ice in a hot drink. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter awe and fear-to-peace transition with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:33] He called me by name… "I'm Moroni, sent straight from God's throne to you." Said my mission? Big time. My name's gonna get dropped across every nation, tribe, language ... good or bad. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter prophetic call with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:34] Moroni drops the mic: there's a book written on golden plates, detailing the first people who lived here and where they came from. Full gospel of Jesus? Locked inside ... exactly like the Savior delivered it to ancient tribes. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter revelation about ancient scripture with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:35] Also? Two silver-stone gems ... strapped to a chest plate, that Urim and Thummim setup. Ancient seers used these to read the divine truth... and God put 'em in the golden plates for translation. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter ancient seer tech with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:36] After dropping all that, Moroni starts quoting Old Testament prophecies ... first Malachi 3, then the last chapter (same book), but with a subtle tweak. Didn't copy the Bible text exactly... made it his own flavor. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter prophetic quote twist with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:37] Day coming where everything gets roasted like a snack ... all the arrogant and wicked ones? Burned like dry grass. "They'll be gone, no roots, no branches," says Lord of Hosts. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter apocalyptic wrath with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:38] Then he drops this: "I'm gonna give you the Priesthood straight from Elijah the prophet ... right before that massive, terrifying day of God's wrath hits." Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter prophetic reveal with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:39] Then he says: "Elijah's gonna plant those ancient promises in kids' hearts ... so they'll love their ancestors again. If that didn't happen? The whole planet would just burn up when he shows up." Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter spiritual revival prophecy with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:40] Also? He quotes Isaiah 11 ... it's about to go live. Then drops Acts 22...23, straight from the Bible, like a full script. Says that prophet? Christ. But the warning "those who won't listen get cut off" ain't happened yet… but it's comin' soon. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter prophetic timeline with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:41] Then he quotes Joel 2...from verse 28 to the end...still not happened yet… but *so* close. Said the Gentiles? Gonna flood in like a wave, soon. And he quoted way more scripture, gave deep cuts no one can explain here. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter prophetic buildup with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:42] Again, he said: once I get those golden plates...still not here yet...I don't show 'em to anyone. Not even the Urim and Thummim. Only to people I'm told to. If I do? Instant wipe. While talking about 'em, I got a vision...clear as a TikTok filter...and saw where they're buried. Know that spot like I visited it ten times before. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter sacred secrecy with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:43] After that talk, the lights in the room started pooling around Moroni like a glow-up... stayed tight until suddenly the whole room went dark except for his zone. Then I saw a portal open straight to heaven ... he vanished like a glitched out DM, and the room was back to normal. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter heavenly exit with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:44] I was just vibing on how wild that scene was... when all of a sudden, the room started lighting up again like a fail-safe alarm. And boom ... Moroni's back at my bedside, same energy, no cap. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter supernatural reappearance with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:45] He drops the same script again...no edits, no lies...just pure copy-paste energy. Then says: massive judgments coming...famine, war, disease...hitting Earth *right now*. This gen? Broke. After that, he vanishes like a deleted DM. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter apocalyptic warning with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:46] By this time, my mind was locked in like a vault...sleep? Gone. Then boom ... Moroni back at my bedside, repeating the same stuff again, just like before. And he drops a cold warn: Satan's gonna tempt me to grab the plates for money ... *especially* since my fam is broke. No cap. Said I must only get 'em to glorify God, not for profit or flex. Any other motive? My hands go straight to heaven and get revoked. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter spiritual warfare warning with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:47] After third time he vanished like a meme gone viral...I'm just processing how deep this shit is. Then...*crack*...the cock crows. Day's here. Real talk, my entire conversation with Moroni took up the whole night. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter supernatural timeline with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:48] I woke up and tried to go back to normal day grind… but my energy? Zero. My dad saw it and said "man, you're not in the zone," told me to head home. Tried to cross the fence...boom...strength dropped like a cursed TikTok video...and I just collapsed on the ground, out cold for good. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter physical collapse with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:49] First thing I remember? A voice calling my name. Look up ... Moroni standing over me, lit like a midnight rave. Said the same stuff as before… just repeated it for real. Then told me to go straight to my dad and drop the full vision + commands on him. No cap. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter divine command with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:50] I obeyed like a pro ... went straight to my dad and dropped the full vision. He said "this is God's word," then told me to go do what Moroni commanded. Headed to that spot...and *instantly* knew where it was ... like a GPS from heaven, no fail. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter obedience with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:51] Right next to Manchester, Ontario County, NY ... there's a big hill, tallest in the area. On the west side, near the top, under a massive stone, the plates were buried...in a stone box. The stone was thick in the middle, rounded on top, edges buried in dirt like a crypto vault. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter real-world location with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:52] I dug out the dirt, got a lever, rigged it under the stone...and with a little effort, lifted it like lifting a cursed TikTok trend. Looked inside...there they were: the plates, Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate. Exactly what Moroni said. The box was built from stacked stones cemented tight. Two crosswise stones at the bottom...plates and all on top, like a vault with zero fail. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter archaeological reveal with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:53] Tried to grab them? Nope. Moroni blocked it like a VIP gate. Said the plates ain't coming out till four years from now ... and I'm not even close. But he told me: I'll be back at this spot in exactly one year, same energy, same vibes...and we keep doing that until the time comes to get 'em. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter delayed reveal with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:54] So I showed up every year, like a scheduled DM...and every time? Moroni was there, same energy. Gave me intel on what God's doing in the end times ... how his kingdom runs, and what to expect in the last days. No cap. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter year-over-year divine updates with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:55] My fam was broke, so we did manual labor like a real-life hustle ... day jobs, side gigs, whatever came up. Some days home, some days out, but through the grind we managed to stay afloat. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter survival economy with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:56] '23 ... my older brother Alvin died, major fam blow. Oct '25 ... I move in with Josiah Stoal in Chenango County, NY. Heard rumors of a Spanish silver mine in Harmony, Susquehanna Co., PA. He was already digging for it, tried to find it...no luck. Worked for almost a month, then I convinced him to stop. That's how the whole "I was a silver digger" myth started ... full sus. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter origin of a conspiracy theory with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:57] While working for Josiah Stoal, I lived with Isaac Hale ... that's where I first laid eyes on my future wife, Emma Hale. January 18th, 1827...we got married. Still under contract to Stoal, but main-character energy already unlocked. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter love & timeline with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:58] Still claiming I saw a vision? That's how the persecution started...and Emma's dad was like "no way." So we packed it up and got married at Squire Tarbill's house in South Bainbridge, Chenango Co., NY. Right after? Left Stoal's and went back to my dad ... farmed that season like a real-life 9-to-5. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter escape & farming hustle with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:59] Finally time came to get the plates, Urim and Thummim, and breastplate. Sept 22, 1827 ... showed up at the spot like clockwork...the heavenly messenger handed 'em over with a full warning: I'm on the hook for these. If I mess up or lose 'em through negligence? Cut off. But if I protect 'em till he calls again? They stay safe. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter divine responsibility with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:60] Soon realized why I got such strict rules ... every single person in the know was after 'em. Full-blown persecution, like a viral crypto scam on speed dial. Every trick in the book to steal them...but God's wisdom kept 'em safe in my hands till the job was done. When the messenger finally called? I handed 'em over. Still with him ... as of May 2nd, 1838. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter survival & divine handoff with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:61] Still wild rumors flying...fake stuff spread like TikTok drama, targeting my fam and me. If I listed even a tiny fraction? It'd fill books. Persecution got so bad we had to bail on Manchester...ran to Susquehanna County, PA. Poor as chips, no safety net...then Martin Harris showed up, gave me $50 for the trip. He lived in Palmyra Township, Wayne Co., NY...a solid farmer with real vibes. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter escape & unexpected ally with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:62] Thanks to Martin Harris's $50, we made it to PA. Right after landing? Started copying the plate characters like a digital vault. Copied a bunch...used Urim and Thummim to translate some of it. Did that from Dec '27 to Feb next year ... full main-character energy, no cap. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter translation hustle with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:63] Sometime in Feb, Martin Harris showed up at our place, snatched the plate characters I'd drawn, and took 'em to NYC. For what happened next? He told me himself after returning...full receipts, no filters. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter transfer & accountability with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:64] I showed the translated characters to Prof Charles Anthon in NYC...man known for literary skills. He said the translation was spot-on, better than any Egyptian text he'd seen. Then confirmed the rest were real: Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyriac, Arabic...full truth, no sus. Gave me a cert for Palmyra saying they're legit and the translations are solid. I slipped it in my pocket...just leaving when Anthon asked how I knew about the gold plates. Said an angel of God revealed it to me. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter validation & divine revelation with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:65] Anthon asked to see the cert...I handed it over, then he tore it up like a real-life conspiracy drama...said no such thing as angel-ministering, and if I brought the plates? He'd translate 'em. Told me part were sealed, and I couldn't bring 'em. Said "can't read sealed books." Then I went to Dr. Mitchell...he backed Anthon up...said both the characters and translation were legit. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter rejection & validation with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:66] April 5, 1829...Oliver Cowdery shows up at my house for first time. Had been teaching school near my dad's place, boarded there...and the fam spilled the beans about me getting the plates. So he came to dig deeper. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter meet-up & curiosity with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:67] Two days after Cowdery showed up...April 7...I started translating the Book of Mormon, and he jumped in with pen and paper. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter collaboration & early work with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:68] We were still translating when in May '29 we went into the woods to pray about baptism for sins...something mentioned in the plates. While praying, a heavenly messenger dropped from a cloud of light, laid hands on us, and ordained us. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter divine visitation with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:69] To my fellow servants in Christ's name, I give you the Aaronic Priesthood...keys to angel ministry, repentance, and baptism by immersion for sin forgiveness.

[Joseph Smith--History 1:70] Said the Aaronic Priesthood don't have Holy Ghost power yet...only coming later. Ordered us to get baptized...I'd baptize Oliver first, then he'd do me. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter baptism sequence with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:71] We went and got baptized...me first, then Oliver. I did the dip, then he did mine. After that, I laid hands on him and ordained him to the Aaronic Priesthood...then he did the same for me. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter ordination & ritual with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:72] The heavenly dude who showed up called himself John...same John the Baptist from the New Testament...and said he was acting under Peter, James, and John, who held the Melchizedek Priesthood. Said that one would come to us later...I'd be first Elder of the Church, Oliver second. Ordained & baptized on May 15, 1829. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter lineage & titles with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:73] Right after we came out of the water post-baptism, we got massive divine blessings. As soon as I baptized Oliver, the Holy Ghost hit him...stood up and prophesied things that'd happen soon. Then when he baptized me? Same energy hit...spoke on this Church's rise, future, and what's coming for Gen Z kids. We were full of the Holy Ghost...and literally just vibin' with God. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter spiritual breakthroughs with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:74] Our minds got fully lit...suddenly the scriptures made sense, mysterious parts now revealed like magic. We never saw this before...but now it's all clear. Still had to keep the Priesthood & baptism a secret though, because the neighborhood already went full sus on us. Full "no 'just generic divine instruction' energy, just sharp, no-filter enlightenment & persecution with zero cap," "no cap."
[Joseph Smith--History 1:75] We kept getting threatened with being mobbed...by religious "experts" who just wanted to shut it down.
