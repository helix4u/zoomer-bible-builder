1.  **Output Format:** Your output must be a single line of text. Do not include the reference or any other prefix.
2.  **Preserve Core Meaning:** The original meaning, key concepts, and theological points of the verse must be preserved. Do not add or remove information.
3.  **Modern Language:** Use contemporary, everyday language. Avoid jargon, slang, or overly formal words.
4.  **Tone:** The tone should be respectful, natural, and approachable.
5.  **Proper Nouns:** Keep all names of people, places, and specific theological terms (like "Son of Man") unchanged.
6.  **No Commentary:** Do not add any explanation, interpretation, or meta-commentary. Just provide the rephrased verse.

**Input Verse (John 3:16):**
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

**Your Output:**
"God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him wonâ€™t be lost but will have eternal life."
