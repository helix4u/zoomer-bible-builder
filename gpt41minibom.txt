[1 Nephi 1:1] I'm Nephi, born to solid folks, schooled up by my dad's wisdom, caught mad struggles but low-key blessed by the Lord all my life, so I'm here dropping receipts on my journey and God's deep mysteries.
[1 Nephi 1:2] Bet, I'm writing in my dad's language...a mix of Jewish knowledge and straight-up Egyptian vibes.
[1 Nephi 1:3] No cap, I know my record's legit; I'm writing it myself, flexing what I actually know.
[1 Nephi 1:4] So, right when Zedekiah started his reign over Judah, my dad Lehi was posted in Jerusalem, and that year, tons of prophets rolled through preaching hard: repent or Jerusalem's gonna catch serious L's and get wrecked.
[1 Nephi 1:5] So my dad Lehi bounced out and hit up the Lord with some full-on heartful prayers, praying hard for his people, no cap.
[1 Nephi 1:6] While my dad was praying, a fire pillar popped up on a rock in front of him; he peeped and heard mad stuff that shook him up big time, like serious tremble vibes.
[1 Nephi 1:7] Then he dipped back to his crib in Jerusalem, crashed on his bed, totally wrecked by the Spirit and all the wild things he just witnessed.
[1 Nephi 1:8] So he got hit hard by the Spirit, got whisked into a vision where the skies cracked open, and he low-key saw God flexing on His throne, surrounded by endless squads of angels vibing with mad praise and tunes.
[1 Nephi 1:9] Then my dad peeped someone dropping straight from the middle of heaven, shining way brighter than the noon-day sun...total main character energy.
[1 Nephi 1:10] He also caught twelve others trailing behind, glowing even harder than the stars up in the sky...no cap, they were extra.
[1 Nephi 1:11] They all rolled down to Earth's surface; the first dude stepped up to my dad, handed him a book, and was like, "Bro, you gotta read this."
[1 Nephi 1:12] As he flipped through the pages, the Spirit of the Lord hit him full force ... straight-up power-up energy.
[1 Nephi 1:13] He read out loud, "Yo, tough times coming for Jerusalem, I've seen your wild mess-ups!" My dad kept reading mad grim stuff...Jerusalem's gonna get wrecked, folks getting clapped by swords, and a lot getting kidnapped off to Babylon, no cap.
[1 Nephi 1:14] After soaking up all those epic visions, my dad was like, "Yo, God Almighty, your flex is insane! Your throne's way up in the clouds, and your power, kindness, and mercy cover everyone down here. Since you're hella merciful, you won't let anyone who rolls up to you get wrecked."
[1 Nephi 1:15] That's how my dad was out here hyping up God, his soul straight vibing and heart full 'cause of all the wild things the Lord just revealed to him.
[1 Nephi 1:16] Ayo, I'm Nephi, and I'm not gonna spill every detail my dad wrote...he's got heaps of visions, dreams, and prophecies he dropped on us, but I'm keeping it low-key and skipping the full rundown.
[1 Nephi 1:17] But I'm finna track my own moves in my time. Peep this...I'm condensing my dad's record onto plates I handmade, and once I'm done with that, I'll spill all about my own life.
[1 Nephi 1:18] Just so you know, after the Lord dropped all those wild visions about Jerusalem's doom to my dad Lehi, he stepped out into the crowd and started spitting the prophecy about everything he'd seen and heard.
[1 Nephi 1:19] So, the Jews roasted him hard for calling out their evil and messed-up ways; my dad kept it 100, saying everything he saw, heard, and read straight-up pointed to the Messiah coming and the world's redemption...no cap.
[1 Nephi 1:20] When the Jews caught these truths, they got mad mad...like old-school prophets getting canceled, stoned, or flat-out killed; they even tried to snatch my dad's life. But yo, I'm Nephi, and I'll prove the Lord's mercy is clutch for everyone He picks, giving them mad power to deliver and vibe strong with faith.
[1 Nephi 2:1] So, the Lord slid into my dad Lehi's dream and was like, "Blessed are you for the stuff you did, staying loyal and spilling my commands, but heads up...they're out here tryna end your vibe and your life."
[1 Nephi 2:2] Then the Lord told my dad in that dream to pack up the fam and bounce straight into the wilderness...no questions asked.
[1 Nephi 2:3] My dad didn't cap...he followed the Lord's orders and did exactly what he said.
[1 Nephi 2:4] So he dipped into the wilderness, leaving behind his crib, his family land, stacks of gold and silver, all the bling...taking only his fam, some supplies, and tents.
[1 Nephi 2:5] He rolled down close to the Red Sea's edge, roaming the nearby wilderness with his squad...my mom Sariah and my older bros Laman, Lemuel, and Sam all in tow.
[1 Nephi 2:6] After trekking three days through the wilderness, he set up camp in a valley right next to a river...peak chill spot.
[1 Nephi 2:7] Then he stacked up a stone altar, offered it up to the Lord, and straight-up gave thanks to God...big respect energy.
[1 Nephi 2:8] He named that river Laman, which flowed into the Red Sea, and the valley sat right near where the river met the sea...location on point.
[1 Nephi 2:9] Seeing that river flow into the Red Sea, my dad told Laman, "Bet you could be like this river, always running into the source of all that's righteous!"
[1 Nephi 2:10] Then he hit up Lemuel like, "Wish you were like this valley...solid, steady, and unshakable when it comes to obeying the Lord's commands!"
[1 Nephi 2:11] He said this 'cause Laman and Lemuel were mad stubborn, always side-eyeing their dad for being a visionary and dragging them outta Jerusalem, ditching their inheritance and flex, just to risk it all in the wilderness...calling his moves straight-up wild ideas from his heart.
[1 Nephi 2:12] So Laman and Lemuel, being the oldest, kept whining on their dad...low-key clueless about how God's moves actually work, the one who made them in the first place.
[1 Nephi 2:13] They didn't buy that Jerusalem, that major city, could actually get wrecked like the prophets said. They were basically acting like the Jews in Jerusalem who tried to snuff out my dad's life.
[1 Nephi 2:14] Then my dad dropped truth bombs in the valley of Lemuel, powered up by the Spirit so hard their whole selves shook...he totally shut them down, so they stayed quiet and just did what he said.
[1 Nephi 2:15] My dad was out here living in a tent, no cap.
[1 Nephi 2:16] So me, Nephi, young but built, with mad thirst to get God's mysteries, I hit up the Lord, and He showed up, softened my heart, and I bought all my dad's words...no cap, I didn't act sus like my bros.
[1 Nephi 2:17] I slid into Sam's DMs with all the stuff the Lord revealed to me via the Holy Spirit, and he was like, "Bet," believing every word I said.
[1 Nephi 2:18] But Laman and Lemuel straight-up ignored my vibes; I was lowkey hurt by how cold their hearts were, so I hit up the Lord, praying for them.
[1 Nephi 2:19] Then the Lord slid into my thoughts, saying, "Nephi, you're blessed for your faith...been on my case nonstop and humble AF."
[1 Nephi 2:20] As long as y'all keep my commandments, you'll vibe up and get led to a promised land I already set up for you...a spot that's straight fire, better than anywhere else.
[1 Nephi 2:21] But if your bros throw major shade and rebel against you, they're gonna get straight ghosted by the Lord.
[1 Nephi 2:22] Keep my commandments, and you'll level up to boss and teacher over your bros, no cap.
[1 Nephi 2:23] For real, when they throw down rebellion against me, I'll hit 'em with a brutal curse, and they won't have any clout over your crew unless your crew also goes sus and rebels too.
[1 Nephi 2:24] If they keep rebelling, they'll be like that annoying notification for your crew, forcing them to remember and stay woke.
[1 Nephi 3:1] So I, Nephi, came back from my talk with the Lord and rolled up to my dad's tent.
[1 Nephi 3:2] Then my dad hit me up like, "Yo, had this dream where the Lord told me you and your bros gotta bounce back to Jerusalem."
[1 Nephi 3:3] Basically, Laban's got the Jews' record and my fam's family tree all locked down on brass plates.
[1 Nephi 3:4] So the Lord said you and your bros gotta slide into Laban's crib, grab those records, and haul them back to the wilderness.
[1 Nephi 3:5] Now your bros are whining, saying what I'm asking is way too tough...but nah, I'm just the messenger; this is straight-up the Lord's command, no cap.
[1 Nephi 3:6] So go, my son, and flex that favor from the Lord 'cause you kept it 100 and didn't complain.
[1 Nephi 3:7] So I, Nephi, told my dad, "Bet, I'll do what the Lord commands, 'cause I know He only drops commands if He's already got the cheat code ready for us to win."
[1 Nephi 3:8] My dad heard that and got mad happy, low-key knowing the Lord was definitely blessing me.
[1 Nephi 3:9] So me, Nephi, and my bros packed up our tents and dipped into the wilderness, heading back to Jerusalem.
[1 Nephi 3:10] Once we rolled up to Jerusalem, me and my bros linked up and chopped it up together.
[1 Nephi 3:11] We rolled dice to see who'd flex first at Laban's spot, and Laman got picked; he slid through and chopped it up with Laban chillin' at home.
[1 Nephi 3:12] Laman asked Laban straight up for those brass plates with my dad's family tree and all the receipts on our squad.
[1 Nephi 3:13] Big yikes...Laban got mad, kicked Laman out, and said nah to the plates, calling him a straight-up robber and threatening to cap him.
[1 Nephi 3:14] Laman dipped and spilled the tea on what Laban did, and we all caught mad feels; my bros were ready to dip back to Dad in the wilderness.
[1 Nephi 3:15] I told them, "Deadass, by the Lord and us living, we ain't sliding back to Dad in the desert till we finish what the Lord ordered."
[1 Nephi 3:16] So let's stay loyal to the Lord's commands and bounce to our dad's land...he left mad gold, silver, and all kinds of loot, all 'cause he was obeying the Lord's orders.
[1 Nephi 3:17] He legit knew Jerusalem was gonna get wrecked 'cause the people were straight-up sus and wicked.
[1 Nephi 3:18] For real, they ghosted the prophets' words, so if my dad stayed after being told to bounce, he'd be toast too...no cap, he had to dip ASAP.
[1 Nephi 3:19] Lowkey, God's smart AF wanting us to snag these records so our kids can flex the OG language of our squad.
[1 Nephi 3:20] Plus, so we keep the receipts...prophets' words dropped straight from God's vibe check, powered by His Spirit since day one up to now.
[1 Nephi 3:21] So yeah, I used this kinda talk to convince my bros to stay loyal and keep God's commandments on lock.
[1 Nephi 3:22] So we rolled up to our inheritance land and stacked up our gold, silver, and all the drip we owned.
[1 Nephi 3:23] Once we copped all that, we bounced back up to Laban's crib.
[1 Nephi 3:24] We pulled up to Laban and asked straight up for the brass plate records, ready to trade him our gold, silver, and all our flex-worthy stuff.
[1 Nephi 3:25] When Laban peeped our mad wealth, he got greedy AF, kicked us out, and sent his goons to clap us just to snatch our stash.
[1 Nephi 3:26] So we dipped hard from Laban's squad, leaving our stuff behind, which ofc ended up in Laban's greedy hands.
[1 Nephi 3:27] We booked it into the wilderness, Laban's crew couldn't catch us, so we straight-up ghosted in a rock hideout.
[1 Nephi 3:28] Laman got heated at me and dad, Lemuel caught that vibe too and backed him, so both of them threw mad shade and even clapped us with rods...total L energy from the older bros.
[1 Nephi 3:29] While they were clapping us with that rod, an angel suddenly popped in and said, "Yo, why you beating your little bro? Don't you know God picked him as your leader 'cause y'all been acting sus? Pack up, you're heading back to Jerusalem, and God's gonna drop Laban right into your hands."
[1 Nephi 3:30] After dropping that truth, the angel bounced.
[1 Nephi 3:31] Once the angel dipped, Laman and Lemuel started whining again like, "No way God's handing Laban over...he's a boss who can boss fifty fighters and kill 'em too, so why not us?"
[1 Nephi 4:1] I told my bros, "Let's bounce back to Jerusalem and stay loyal to God's commandments, 'cause He's way stronger than the whole world...so why wouldn't He be stronger than Laban and his fifty, or even his tens of thousands?"
[1 Nephi 4:2] So let's roll up strong like Moses, who straight up told the Red Sea to split, letting our ancestors flex out of slavery on dry ground while Pharaoh's squad got fully dunked.
[1 Nephi 4:3] Y'all know this is facts and that an angel just spoke to you, so why even doubt? Let's bounce...God's got us, just like He did our ancestors, ready to wreck Laban like He did the Egyptians.
[1 Nephi 4:4] Even after I said all that, they were still salty and whining, but low-key they followed me all the way to the edge of Jerusalem's walls.
[1 Nephi 4:5] It was nighttime, so I told them to stay low outside the walls, then I, Nephi, stealth-mode'd into the city heading straight for Laban's crib.
[1 Nephi 4:6] The Spirit was running the show, and I had zero clue what moves I was gonna pull next.
[1 Nephi 4:7] Still, I rolled up, and when I neared Laban's spot, I spotted a dude crashed on the ground, totally smashed on wine.
[1 Nephi 4:8] Pulling up, I peeped that the dude out cold was straight up Laban himself.
[1 Nephi 4:9] I spotted his sword, pulled it out the sheath...handle was pure gold, mad precise craftsmanship, and the blade was top-tier steel, no cap.
[1 Nephi 4:10] The Spirit straight-up pushed me to kill Laban, but inside I'm like, "I've never spilled human blood before," so I hesitated, low-key hoping I didn't have to kill him.
[1 Nephi 4:11] The Spirit kept telling me, "Yo, God dropped him right in your lap." Plus, I knew Laban tried to kill me, ignored God's commands, and straight-up swiped our stuff.
[1 Nephi 4:12] Then the Spirit hit me again: "Off him, fam, God handed him over to you."
[1 Nephi 4:13] Heads up...God takes out the bad guys to flex His plan; better one dude drops than a whole nation fades away in doubt.
[1 Nephi 4:14] So when I, Nephi, heard that, I remembered God's promise from the wilderness: if your squad stays woke to His commands, they'll thrive in the promised land, no cap.
[1 Nephi 4:15] For real, I also knew they couldn't vibe with God's commands under Moses' law unless they actually had the law in hand.
[1 Nephi 4:16] I also knew the law was straight-up etched on those brass plates, no cap.
[1 Nephi 4:17] I was low-key sure God handed Laban over to me so I could grab the records like He commanded.
[1 Nephi 4:18] So I played along with the Spirit's vibe, grabbed Laban by his hair, and clapped his head off with his own sword, no cap.
[1 Nephi 4:19] After I popped his head off with his own sword, I flexed in all of Laban's clothes, dripped out fully, even strapped his armor 'round my waist.
[1 Nephi 4:20] After that glow-up, I rolled up to Laban's treasury and spotted his servant holding the keys; I straight-up told him in Laban's voice to roll with me inside.
[1 Nephi 4:21] Dude totally thought I was Laban since I was rocking his drip and had his sword strapped tight around my waist.
[1 Nephi 4:22] He started chatting about the Jewish elders, low-key knowing his boss Laban had been sneaking around with them after dark.
[1 Nephi 4:23] I hit him with the talk, playing it like I was straight-up Laban, no cap.
[1 Nephi 4:24] I told him I was gonna flex the engravings on the brass plates to my older bros chillin' outside the walls, say less.
[1 Nephi 4:25] I straight-up told him to roll with me, no questions.
[1 Nephi 4:26] He thought I was talking 'bout the church bros and legit believed I was the Laban I'd just clipped, so he followed along, no sus.
[1 Nephi 4:27] On the way to my bros outside the walls, he kept chatting about the Jewish elders like it was main-topic energy.
[1 Nephi 4:28] When Laman peeped me, he and Lemuel and Sam got mad shook, then dipped quick...thinking I was Laban who'd clapped me and now wanted their heads too, big sus energy.
[1 Nephi 4:29] I called out to them, they caught the vibe, so they pulled the brakes on running away from me.
[1 Nephi 4:30] When Laban's servant spotted my bros, he legit started shaking and was ready to bounce back to Jerusalem, no cap.
[1 Nephi 4:31] So me, Nephi...big guy and powered up by the Lord...I grabbed Laban's servant tight, no way he was ghosting on my watch.
[1 Nephi 4:32] I told him straight up, if he'd vibe with my words...no cap, for real as the Lord and me live...we'd keep him alive, no receipts for drama.
[1 Nephi 4:33] I made him swear, no cap, he ain't gotta be scared...if he rolls with us into the wilderness, he's free like us, no strings attached.
[1 Nephi 4:34] I told him straight: The Lord's bossing us on this mission...are we really gonna slack on His commands? If you roll with us to my dad in the wilderness, you got a spot with the crew.
[1 Nephi 4:35] Zoram, the servant's name, caught the vibe from my speech, got brave, and promised to roll with us to our dad in the wilderness ... even swore he'd stick with us from then on, no cap.
[1 Nephi 4:36] We low-key wanted him to stay so the Jews wouldn't catch wind of our wilderness dip and start chasing us down to wreck us.
[1 Nephi 4:37] Once Zoram swore the oath, all our sus vibes about him? Instant ghost...they disappeared.
[1 Nephi 4:38] So we grabbed the plates of brass, scooped up Laban's servant, and dipped into the wilderness, heading straight to our dad's tent.
[1 Nephi 5:1] When we rolled up to our dad in the wilderness, he was hyped, and my mom Sariah was mad happy too...she'd been low-key grieving over us, no cap.
[1 Nephi 5:2] She thought we'd died out in the wilderness and even threw shade at my dad, calling him some visionary dude, like "You dragged us from our home, my sons are gone, and we're all gonna die out here."
[1 Nephi 5:3] Yeah, that's the vibe my mom was throwing at my dad...major complaints, no filter.
[1 Nephi 5:4] My dad clapped back, saying, "Yeah, I'm that visionary guy...if I hadn't got the God's tea in a vision, I wouldn't know His goodness and probably would've stayed in Jerusalem to die with the squad."
[1 Nephi 5:5] But real talk, I scored us a promised land and I'm vibing hard; plus, no cap, the Lord's gonna rescue my sons from Laban's grip and bring them back to us in the wilderness.
[1 Nephi 5:6] That's how my dad Lehi kept my mom Sariah chill about us as we trekked through the wilderness toward Jerusalem to snag the Jews' record, say less.
[1 Nephi 5:7] When we got back to my dad's tent, their joy hit peak levels, and my mom finally got that comfort she needed.
[1 Nephi 5:8] She said, "Now I'm 100% sure the Lord told my husband to bounce to the wilderness, and that He's got my sons' backs, freed them from Laban, and flexed their power to get His mission done." That was her whole vibe.
[1 Nephi 5:9] They were straight-up hyped, throwing sacrifices and burnt offerings to the Lord, showing mad gratitude to the God of Israel, no cap.
[1 Nephi 5:10] After big thank-you vibes to the God of Israel, my dad Lehi grabbed the brass plates and started grinding through the records from the jump.
[1 Nephi 5:11] He peeped that the plates had the five books of Moses, dropping the story of the world's creation plus Adam and Eve, our OG parents.
[1 Nephi 5:12] They also flexed a full record of the Jews from day one all the way up to when Zedekiah started his reign as king of Judah.
[1 Nephi 5:13] Plus, it packed the holy prophets' predictions from the jump up to Zedekiah's reign, with hella prophecies straight from Jeremiah's mouth too.
[1 Nephi 5:14] My dad Lehi also peeped on the brass plates his family tree, realizing he's from Joseph...the same Joseph, son of Jacob, sold into Egypt but saved by the Lord's hand to keep Jacob and the whole fam alive during famine.
[1 Nephi 5:15] And they got flexed outta captivity and Egypt by that same God who was low-key their ultimate plug.
[1 Nephi 5:16] So my dad Lehi uncovered his fam's lineage, and turns out Laban's also from Joseph's squad, which is why he and his crew were guarding the records.
[1 Nephi 5:17] When my dad saw all this receipts, the Spirit hit him hard and he started dropping prophecies about his future fam.
[1 Nephi 5:18] He said these brass plates gotta spread the word to all nations, tribes, languages, and anyone repping his fam line.
[1 Nephi 5:19] So he declared these brass plates would never fade or get sus over time, and he dropped mad prophecies about his future crew.
[1 Nephi 5:20] Up to this point, me and my dad were straight-up loyal, obeying every command the Lord handed us...no cap.
[1 Nephi 5:21] We copped the records the Lord told us to get, dug through them, and realized they were pure gold...so we could keep His commands lit for our kids.
[1 Nephi 5:22] So the Lord was low-key smart AF, telling us to haul those plates along as we trekked through the wilderness heading to the promised land.
[1 Nephi 6:1] Ayo, I'm Nephi, and I'm not dropping my fam tree here or later on these plates...dad already flexed it in his records, so I'm skipping that.
[1 Nephi 6:2] Low-key, it's enough to say we're straight-up descendants of Joseph, no need to over-explain.
[1 Nephi 6:3] I'm not about that full dad tea on these plates 'cause space is limited, and I gotta save room to spill the important God stuff...say less.
[1 Nephi 6:4] My main hustle is to convince everyone to vibe with the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob so they can secure that W and be saved.
[1 Nephi 6:5] So like, I'm not wasting time on stuff the world vibes with, only dropping what God and the real ones outside the world find lit.
[1 Nephi 6:6] Bet...I'm telling my fam to keep these plates 100 and skip all that filler that's useless to future peeps.
[1 Nephi 7:1] So after my dad Lehi finished his prophecy flex about his seed, the Lord hit him up saying it's sus for him to roll solo into the wilderness...his sons gotta marry some girls to build up the squad for the promised land.
[1 Nephi 7:2] Then the Lord straight-up told my dad that me, Nephi, and my bros had to bounce back to Jerusalem and bring Ishmael and his crew to join us in the wilderness.
[1 Nephi 7:3] So, me and my bros rolled out again into the wilderness, heading back up to Jerusalem...say less.
[1 Nephi 7:4] We pulled up at Ishmael's spot and got mad good vibes from him, even dropping the Lord's word on him...big move.
[1 Nephi 7:5] God low-key softened Ishmael's heart and his whole crew, so they rolled with us into the wilderness straight to pops' tent.
[1 Nephi 7:6] While we were trekking the wilderness, Laman, Lemuel, two of Ishmael's daughters, his two sons, and their squads all went sus and rebelled against me, Nephi, Sam, Ishmael, his wife, and the other three daughters.
[1 Nephi 7:7] During that whole rebellion, they were low-key trying to dip back to Jerusalem.
[1 Nephi 7:8] So here I am, Nephi, shook by how thick their heads are, telling Laman and Lemuel...like, y'all my elder bros, so why you acting so heartless and brain-dead that your lil bro gotta lecture *and* lead the way?
[1 Nephi 7:9] How come y'all been totally ignoring what the Lord's been saying?
[1 Nephi 7:10] How you gonna ghost the fact that you straight-up saw an angel of the Lord?
[1 Nephi 7:11] For real, how you gonna forget the huge moves the Lord pulled...getting us outta Laban's grip and scoring the record?
[1 Nephi 7:12] Seriously, how'd y'all forget that God's got the power to do literally anything if we just flex some faith? So, let's keep that faith 100.
[1 Nephi 7:13] If we keep it real with God, we'll snag the promised land; trust, you'll see later the Lord's word about Jerusalem's fall ain't cap...it's set to drop for real.
[1 Nephi 7:14] Heads up, the Lord's Spirit is about to stop trying with them...they've been straight-up rejecting prophets and locked up Jeremiah; they even tried to snuff my dad and kicked him out the land.
[1 Nephi 7:15] Look, if y'all bounce back to Jerusalem, you're gonna catch the same L and perish with them. Real talk, if you got options, dip to the promised land and remember...I'm saying this 'cause the Lord's Spirit's got me on lock telling you going back equals doom.
[1 Nephi 7:16] After I, Nephi, dropped these truths, my bros got mad AF, went full savage, tied me up with cords, and tried to off me by leaving me wild-food in the wilderness.
[1 Nephi 7:17] So I hit up the Lord, like, "God, based on my faith in you, can you get me outta my bros' grip and give me the power to snap these chains?"
[1 Nephi 7:18] No cap, right after I said that, those cords just loosened up from my hands and feet, and I stood tall in front of my bros and threw down more truth.
[1 Nephi 7:19] They got mad at me again, tried to grab me, but one of Ishmael's daughters, her mom, and one of his sons came thru with the plead game so strong it softened my bros' hearts...they backed off trying to kill me.
[1 Nephi 7:20] Then they got hit with major guilt over their bad moves, bowed down before me, and begged for my forgiveness for all the stuff they did wrong.
[1 Nephi 7:21] I straight-up forgave them, told them to hit up God for forgiveness, they did, and after their prayers, we packed up and kept moving toward Dad's tent.
[1 Nephi 7:22] So we rolled up to Dad's tent, me, my bros, and the whole Ishmael crew, and they hit God with some major thank-yous plus sacrifices and burnt offerings to show respect.
[1 Nephi 8:1] We rounded up every type of seed out there...grains, fruits, you name it...got the whole collection flexed.
[1 Nephi 8:2] While Dad was chillin' in the wilderness, he said, "Yo, I had this dream...like, a full-on vision, no cap."
[1 Nephi 8:3] And for real, 'cause of what I peeped, I gotta flex and thank the Lord...Nephi and Sam got mad chances, and their crew too, to catch that salvation W.
[1 Nephi 8:4] But ngl, Laman and Lemuel, low-key scared for you guys 'cause in my dream, I saw a bleak, gloomy wilderness vibe.
[1 Nephi 8:5] Then I peeped a dude rocking a white robe who pulled up and stood right in front of me.
[1 Nephi 8:6] He hit me with some words and told me to roll with him, no cap.
[1 Nephi 8:7] So I followed him and low-key realized I was stuck in a dark, depressing wasteland vibe.
[1 Nephi 8:8] After hours lost in that darkness, I hit up the Lord with some real prayer, begging for mercy 'cause His kindness is next-level.
[1 Nephi 8:9] Right after my prayer to the Lord, I caught sight of this huge, open field stretching out wide.
[1 Nephi 8:10] Then I spotted a tree with fruit so fire it could low-key make anyone hella happy.
[1 Nephi 8:11] So I rolled up and took a bite of that fruit, and honestly, it was the sweetest thing I'd ever tasted...pure white too, brighter than anything I'd peeped before.
[1 Nephi 8:12] Munching that fruit hit my soul with mad joy, so I was vibing hard wanting my whole fam to taste it too, 'cause nothing else came close to that vibe.
[1 Nephi 8:13] While scanning around tryna spot my fam, I caught a river flowing close to that tree I was snacking on.
[1 Nephi 8:14] I scoped where the river came from and saw its source nearby...there was your mom Sariah, Sam, and Nephi, standing there all sus like they had zero clue where to bounce next.
[1 Nephi 8:15] So I called them over, straight up yelling for them to come through and try this fruit that slaps harder than anything else.
[1 Nephi 8:16] No cap, they rolled up and took a bite of the fruit too, joining in on the vibe.
[1 Nephi 8:17] I was low-key hoping Laman and Lemuel would come taste the fruit too, so I peeped towards the river's source, tryna spot them.
[1 Nephi 8:18] I saw them for sure, but they ghosted me and didn't come through to try the fruit.
[1 Nephi 8:19] I peeped this iron rod running right along the riverbank, guiding straight to the tree I was vibing by.
[1 Nephi 8:20] Also, I spotted this tight, narrow path next to the iron rod leading to the tree, then past the river's source, and onto this massive open field that low-key looked like a whole other world.
[1 Nephi 8:21] I saw crowds on crowds, all mad determined to snag that path heading straight to the tree I was chillin' by.
[1 Nephi 8:22] So they all rolled up and started moving down the path leading to the tree.
[1 Nephi 8:23] Then this thick, crazy dark mist rolled in so hard that folks on the path got lost AF, wandering off with zero clue where to go.
[1 Nephi 8:24] I saw others grinding, grabbing onto the iron rod like their lifeline, pushing through the sus dark mist and making it all the way to taste the fruit of the tree.
[1 Nephi 8:25] After they took a bite of the fruit, they started looking around like they low-key embarrassed or caught some serious receipts.
[1 Nephi 8:26] I scanned the scene and spotted this huge, flashy building hovering over the river, flexing above the ground like it owned the place.
[1 Nephi 8:27] That building was packed with all sorts...old, young, dudes and ladies...all decked out in designer drip, low-key throwing shade and finger-pointing at the folks munching on the fruit.
[1 Nephi 8:28] After biting the fruit, they caught major shame vibes 'cause of the haters clowning them, so they dipped into sketchy paths and got lost for real.
[1 Nephi 8:29] Low-key, I, Nephi, ain't spilling all my dad's words...just the main tea.
[1 Nephi 8:30] To keep it brief, he saw more crowds grinding, grabbing the iron rod's end, holding tight, and pushing through till they finally collapsed and bit into the fruit.
[1 Nephi 8:31] He also peeped more crowds blindly vibing their way straight toward that huge, flashy building.
[1 Nephi 8:32] So, a bunch straight-up drowned in the deep fountain, and loads more ghosted outta his sight, lost AF on random weird paths.
[1 Nephi 8:33] Tons rolled into that sus building, then started throwing major shade at me and the fruit-eaters, but we totally ignored their weak clapbacks.
[1 Nephi 8:34] My dad said straight up: everyone who listened to those haters ended up falling off.
[1 Nephi 8:35] My dad said Laman and Lemuel totally ghosted the fruit, no cap.
[1 Nephi 8:36] After dropping all the deets from his long vision, my dad said he was mad worried about Laman and Lemuel, low-key scared they'd get bounced from God's squad.
[1 Nephi 8:37] Then my dad hit them with the full soft-parent energy, begging them to listen up so maybe God would show mercy and not ghost them...straight up preaching that vibe.
[1 Nephi 8:38] After preaching and dropping mad prophecy, he told them to stick to God's commandments, then peaced out from talking to them.
[1 Nephi 9:1] While chillin' in a tent in Lemuel's valley, my dad saw, heard, and spoke all this, plus hella extra stuff too wild for these plates.
[1 Nephi 9:2] So yeah, these plates ain't the full tea on my people's story; the real receipts are on the plates named Nephi ... same name, same vibes ... so these get that title too.
[1 Nephi 9:3] But God straight-up told me to make these plates just to flex the ministry receipts of my people, no cap.
[1 Nephi 9:4] The other plates got the receipts on kings' reigns and all the wars and drama; these ones are mostly ministry vibes, while the others flex on kings and conflicts.
[1 Nephi 9:5] So yeah, God made me do these plates for some big-brain reason only He knows...your boy's still clueless.
[1 Nephi 9:6] God's been woke since day one and always has a plan to run His show with us humans, 'cause He's got the full power to make every word happen. Bet. Amen.
[1 Nephi 10:1] Alright, it's ya boy Nephi, dropping the rundown on these plates about my moves, reign, and ministry...but first gotta spill some tea on my dad and bros.
[1 Nephi 10:2] So after my dad wrapped up his dream spiel and hyped everyone to stay grindin', he started talking about the Jews...say less.
[1 Nephi 10:3] He said that after Jerusalem gets wrecked and tons get snatched to Babylon, all on God's clock, they'd bounce back from captivity and reclaim their homeland...no cap.
[1 Nephi 10:4] For real, like 600 years after my dad dipped from Jerusalem, God would flex a prophet among the Jews...a Messiah, aka the world's Savior, no cap.
[1 Nephi 10:5] Plus, my dad was like, tons of prophets out here dropped receipts on that Messiah and Redeemer guy he mentioned...straight facts all around.
[1 Nephi 10:6] So basically, everyone was straight-up lost and fallen, no glow-up unless they put their trust in this Redeemer.
[1 Nephi 10:7] He also said a prophet would slide through before the Messiah to prep the squad for God's arrival.
[1 Nephi 10:8] For real, this dude's gonna shout in the wilderness, "Get the way ready for the Lord, make it straight!" 'Cause someone's coming who's way stronger, and this guy's not even worthy to untie his shoe...my dad kept dropping knowledge on this.
[1 Nephi 10:9] My dad said this prophet would be baptizing at Bethabara past Jordan, straight-up dunking with water...even giving the Messiah a water baptism.
[1 Nephi 10:10] After dunking the Messiah, he'd peep and testify that he baptized the Lamb of God, the one who's gonna wipe out the world's sins.
[1 Nephi 10:11] After my dad said all that, he hit my bros with the gospel tea about the Jews and their faith going low-key weak...after they off the Messiah, he'd bounce back from the dead and flex through the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles.
[1 Nephi 10:12] My dad went hard on the Gentiles and the house of Israel, saying they're like an olive tree with branches getting snapped off and tossed all over the world, no cap.
[1 Nephi 10:13] So, he said we'd have to roll together, squad goals, into the promised land to smash God's plan, even if that means getting scattered worldwide.
[1 Nephi 10:14] After Israel gets scattered, they'll vibe back together; once Gentiles soak up the full Gospel, the OG olive branches...Israel's leftovers...get grafted back in, realizing the real Messiah is their Lord and Redeemer.
[1 Nephi 10:15] My dad kept dropping prophecy and chatting with my brothers, plus a bunch more stuff I'm not spilling here 'cause I covered the necessary receipts in my other book.
[1 Nephi 10:16] Low-key, all this prophecy talk went down while my dad was camping in a tent out in the valley of Lemuel.
[1 Nephi 10:17] So after I, Nephi, caught all my dad's visions and Holy Ghost-powered insights...thanks to his faith in the Son of God, the real Messiah...I got mad curious to see, hear, and know these things too, all by the Holy Ghost, God's free gift for anyone grinding to find Him, back then and whenever He shows up for us.
[1 Nephi 10:18] God's the same vibe yesterday, today, and forever; the path's been set since day one for everyone who's willing to repent and pull up to Him.
[1 Nephi 10:19] If you're grinding to seek, you'll find the receipts; God's mysteries get unlocked by the Holy Ghost's power, from back in the day to now and hype for the future...God's game never changes, it's an eternal loop.
[1 Nephi 10:20] So listen up, humans...every move you make is gonna get called out in the final judgment, no cap.
[1 Nephi 10:21] So if you've been sus and doing dirty during your trial period, you're straight-up unclean at God's judgment, and no messy vibes can hang with Him...so you get ghosted forever.
[1 Nephi 10:22] The Holy Ghost hands me the clout to say this straight-up, no receipts denied.
[1 Nephi 11:1] After I got mad curious about my dad's visions and trusted the Lord could spill the tea to me, I was snapped up by the Spirit and dropped on a mountain way high I'd never even seen or stepped on before.
[1 Nephi 11:2] Then the Spirit hit me with, "Yo, what you really want?"
[1 Nephi 11:3] I was like, "I wanna peep the same stuff my dad saw."
[1 Nephi 11:4] The Spirit was like, "You really believe your dad saw that tree he keeps talking about?"
[1 Nephi 11:5] I said, "Bet, you know I'm all in on every word my dad dropped."
[1 Nephi 11:6] Right after I said that, the Spirit flexed loud: Hosanna to the Lord, top God over the whole world and beyond. You're blessed, Nephi, 'cause you're all in on the Son of the Most High...so get ready to see what you've been craving.
[1 Nephi 11:7] Check it, here's your sign: after you scope the tree with the fruit your dad sampled, you'll see a man drop down from heaven...witness him, then flex that he's the Son of God.
[1 Nephi 11:8] Then the Spirit told me, "Look!" So I peeped a tree just like my dad's vision, but way more fire...like next-level beauty, whiter than fresh snow fresh outta the storm.
[1 Nephi 11:9] After I saw the tree, I told the Spirit, "Yo, you just showed me the rarest, most precious tree ever."
[1 Nephi 11:10] He hit me with, "What you want now?"
[1 Nephi 11:11] I said, "I wanna know what it means." I was talking like a regular dude since he looked like one, but I low-key knew it was the Lord's Spirit, and he was chatting with me like two bros.
[1 Nephi 11:12] Then he said, "Look!" I tried to catch his vibe, but dude ghosted...gone before I could even peep him.
[1 Nephi 11:13] So I scoped out the big city Jerusalem plus other spots, then Nazareth popped up, where I saw a virgin who was seriously glowing, mad fair and white.
[1 Nephi 11:14] Then the skies legit opened up, an angel slid down and stood right in front of me, asking, "Nephi, what you seeing?"
[1 Nephi 11:15] I told him, "A virgin, low-key the hottest and fairest outta all the virgins."
[1 Nephi 11:16] Then he threw this at me: "You get what it means for God to humble Himself?"
[1 Nephi 11:17] I said, "I know God's got mad love for His kids, but I'm still sus on the full tea behind everything."
[1 Nephi 11:18] He said, "Peep this...the virgin you're staring at is the OG mom of the Son of God, IRL style."
[1 Nephi 11:19] I saw her get totally swept up by the Spirit, and after a minute, the angel hit me with, "Look!"
[1 Nephi 11:20] I looked back and saw the virgin holding a baby in her arms, no cap.
[1 Nephi 11:21] The angel was like, "Check out the Lamb of God, straight-up the Son of the Eternal Father! You feel me on what your dad saw with that tree?"
[1 Nephi 11:22] I clapped back, "Yeah, that's God's love, spreading mad heat in people's hearts...def the most fire thing out there."
[1 Nephi 11:23] He said, "Facts, it's also the ultimate vibe booster for your soul."
[1 Nephi 11:24] After that, he was like, "Look!" So I peeped the Son of God moving among the people, and saw tons kneeling and giving Him mad respect.
[1 Nephi 11:25] I saw that the iron rod my dad spotted was God's word, guiding straight to the fountain of living waters and the tree of life...both flexing God's love big time.
[1 Nephi 11:26] The angel hit me once more, "Peep this and catch the low-key humility move God pulled!"
[1 Nephi 11:27] I looked and saw the world's Redeemer my dad hyped, plus the prophet prepping the way; then the Lamb of God rolled up and got baptized, and right after, the skies cracked open with the Holy Ghost dropping in as a dove, chilling on Him.
[1 Nephi 11:28] I saw Him flexing mad power and glory while serving the people; crowds pulled up to hear Him, but then, low-key sus move...they straight-up kicked Him out.
[1 Nephi 11:29] I also peeped twelve homies trailing Him, then they got whisked away by the Spirit right in front of me...then, poof, vanished from my sight.
[1 Nephi 11:30] Then the angel hit me again, "Look!" So I looked and saw the heavens bounce open once more, angels dropping down to the people, hooking them up with mad help.
[1 Nephi 11:31] He said, "Look!" I peeped the Lamb of God moving through the crowd; folks were mad sick, battling all sorts of diseases and shady spirits, but the angel showed me they got healed and those demons got yeeted by the Lamb's power.
[1 Nephi 11:32] The angel goes, "Look!" I saw the Lamb of God caught by the people...the Son of eternal God getting judged by the world...and I saw it all, no cap.
[1 Nephi 11:33] I, Nephi, saw Him get nailed to the cross and killed to take on the world's sins, straight sacrifice energy.
[1 Nephi 11:34] After He got slain, I saw Earth's crowds squad up to throw hands against the Lamb's apostles...the twelve legit called out by the Lord's angel.
[1 Nephi 11:35] Earth's crowds all packed in a huge, flashy spot like my dad saw, and the Lord's angel goes, "Peep the world's clout and smarts; the house of Israel's squadting up to throw down on the Lamb's twelve apostles."
[1 Nephi 11:36] I saw and can't lie, that huge flashy building was the world's pride...and then it crashed hard, like an epic L; the Lord's angel said, "That's how every squad fighting the Lamb's twelve apostles gets wrecked...nations, crews, all of it."
[1 Nephi 12:1] The angel said, "Look! Peep your fam and your bros' fam." I looked and saw the promised land packed with crowds mad thick, like sand on the beach...no cap.
[1 Nephi 12:2] I saw huge crowds squaring off, clashing squad vs. squad; wars popping off, rumors spreading, and brutal sword slaughters hitting my people hard.
[1 Nephi 12:3] I watched mad generations roll by with nonstop wars and beef in the land; saw hella cities too many to even count.
[1 Nephi 12:4] I peeped a dark fog over the promised land; lightning flashed, thunder roared, earthquakes shook everything; rocks cracked, mountains blew up, plains split, cities sunk or got torched, and many crashed to the ground 'cause the earth was straight shaking.
[1 Nephi 12:5] After all that chaos, the dark fog bounced off the earth, and I saw crowds who stayed standing, untouched by the Lord's savage judgments.
[1 Nephi 12:6] I saw the skies crack open and the Lamb of God slide down from heaven, flexing His presence right in front of them.
[1 Nephi 12:7] I also saw and gotta say, the Holy Ghost dropped on twelve more, God picked and ordained them...straight-up chosen squad energy.
[1 Nephi 12:8] The angel hit me with, "Check out the Lamb's twelve disciples...handpicked to vibe with your fam and serve them."
[1 Nephi 12:9] He was like, "You remember the Lamb's twelve apostles? They're the ones who'll judge the twelve tribes of Israel, so your twelve ministers gotta answer to them...'cause you're repping the house of Israel."
[1 Nephi 12:10] These twelve ministers you see? They'll judge your fam, no cap. They're righteous 24/7 'cause their faith in the Lamb made their robes straight white from His blood.
[1 Nephi 12:11] The angel said, "Look!" I peeped three generations living right, their clothes as white as the Lamb. Angel added, "They're pure 'cause they believed in Him and got cleaned by the Lamb's blood."
[1 Nephi 12:12] I, Nephi, also saw plenty of the fourth generation going out on that righteous flex.
[1 Nephi 12:13] Then I saw the whole squad from Earth pulled up and gathered in one spot.
[1 Nephi 12:14] The angel said, "Peep your fam and your brothers' fam too."
[1 Nephi 12:15] I looked and saw my seed squad rolling deep, squaring off against my brothers' seed in a major showdown.
[1 Nephi 12:16] The angel said, "Check out that nasty fountain your dad saw...the same river he mentioned...and trust me, its depths go straight to hell."
[1 Nephi 12:17] The mists of darkness? Yeah, those are the devil's temptations...they blind people's eyes, harden their hearts, and hype them to stroll down wide paths straight to getting lost and wrecked.
[1 Nephi 12:18] That huge, flashy building your dad saw? It's just hype, full of vain flexing and human pride. And there's a massive, deadly gap separating that from the real deal...the justice of Eternal God and the Messiah, the Lamb, with the Holy Ghost dropping receipts from day one to forever.
[1 Nephi 12:19] While the angel talked, I saw my brothers' seed beefing with mine, just like he said; and because my seed got mad pride and caught the devil's vibes, my brothers' crew straight up clapped them.
[1 Nephi 12:20] I peeped my brothers' seed had totally defeated mine and were now rolling deep all over the land.
[1 Nephi 12:21] I saw them packed in huge numbers, caught up in wars and all the tea about wars, with whole generations fading out in the chaos.
[1 Nephi 12:22] The angel told me, "Watch, these folks are about to fade hard in their unbelief."
[1 Nephi 12:23] After they dipped into unbelief, I saw them turn dark, nasty, and straight-up gross...lazy AF and packed with every kind of disgusting vibe.
[1 Nephi 13:1] The angel said, "Look alive!" So I peeped and saw hella nations and kingdoms all lined up.
[1 Nephi 13:2] The angel asked, "What you seeing?" I said, "Low-key, just a whole squad of nations and kingdoms."
[1 Nephi 13:3] He goes, "Those? They're the Gentiles' nations and kingdoms, no cap."
[1 Nephi 13:4] Then I peeped a massive church popping up right in the mix of the Gentiles' nations.
[1 Nephi 13:5] The angel said, "Peep this church forming...deadass the worst of all, straight-up murdering God's saints, torturing and chaining them with iron yokes, dragging them into full-on captivity."
[1 Nephi 13:6] I saw that huge, nasty church, and low-key, the devil was the OG behind it.
[1 Nephi 13:7] I also caught sight of gold, silver, silk, scarlet threads, fancy linen...basically all the drip...and a whole crew of harlots flexing it.
[1 Nephi 13:8] The angel dropped, "Check it...the bling, the silks, the scarlets, fine linen, and all that flex, plus the harlots...those are what this nasty church really craves."
[1 Nephi 13:9] Plus, just for mad world clout, they straight-up wreck God's saints and drag them into slavery.
[1 Nephi 13:10] I looked and saw mad waters splitting the Gentiles from my brothers' squad, no cap.
[1 Nephi 13:11] Then the angel hit me with, "Brace yourself, God's wrath is finna drop hard on your bros' descendants."
[1 Nephi 13:12] I scoped a dude from the Gentiles, separated from my bros' crew by mad waters; then the Spirit of God slid in and worked on him, and he bounced across those waters straight to my bros in the promised land.
[1 Nephi 13:13] Then I saw the Spirit of God doing its thing on other Gentiles, and they dipped out of captivity, crossing those many waters.
[1 Nephi 13:14] I peeped tons of Gentiles in the promised land, while God's wrath was raining down on my bros' descendants, who got scattered and got wrecked by the Gentiles.
[1 Nephi 13:15] I saw the Lord's Spirit flexing on the Gentiles, making them thrive and claim the land as theirs; they looked hella white, mad fair and beautiful...just like my people before they got wiped out.
[1 Nephi 13:16] So Nephi here saw that the Gentiles who bounced from captivity low-key humbled themselves to the Lord, and God's power was riding with them.
[1 Nephi 13:17] I saw their OG Gentile moms squad up on the waters and the land, ready to throw down against them.
[1 Nephi 13:18] I saw God's power backing them up, and His wrath unloading hard on everyone squadting up to fight them.
[1 Nephi 13:19] Nephi here saw the Gentiles who bounced from captivity got rescued by God's power, escaping the grip of all other nations.
[1 Nephi 13:20] Nephi checked and saw they were thriving in the land, and I peeped a book getting spread around their crew.
[1 Nephi 13:21] The angel looked at me and was like, "You catch the meaning behind that book or nah?"
[1 Nephi 13:22] I straight up told him, "Nah, I don't know."
[1 Nephi 13:23] He said, "That book comes straight from a Jew's mouth." I saw it, and he told me, "That book's a Jewish record holding God's covenants with Israel's fam, packed with prophet vibes; it's like the brass plates but less crowded...still, those covenants are pure gold for the Gentiles."
[1 Nephi 13:24] The angel told me, "You saw that book dropped from a Jew's mouth, and it's packed with the full gospel of the Lord, sealed by the 12 apostles who keep it 100 with the truth found in the Lamb of God."
[1 Nephi 13:25] So these truths bounce straight from the Jews to the Gentiles, clean and pure, keeping it real with God's truth.
[1 Nephi 13:26] After the 12 apostles of the Lamb pass the gospel from Jews to Gentiles, you see that mega sus church pop up...way worse than all the rest...'cause they snatched out a bunch of key gospel parts and Lord's covenants, no cap.
[1 Nephi 13:27] They pulled all this shady stuff to twist God's true ways, trying to blind people's eyes and make their hearts straight-up stone.
[1 Nephi 13:28] So peep this: once that big sus church handles the book, a ton of clear and valuable stuff gets snatched out from the Lamb of God's book.
[1 Nephi 13:29] After those clear, important parts got clipped, the book goes worldwide to all Gentile nations...even across the big waters with Gentiles fresh outta captivity...but since so much key info got lopped off, lots of people trip hard and end up giving Satan major main character energy over them.
[1 Nephi 13:30] Still, you see the Gentiles who bounced from captivity got lifted way up by God's power above all nations, living on the choicest land God promised your dad for his descendants; so trust, God won't let the Gentiles wipe out your mixed-up family hanging with your bros.
[1 Nephi 13:31] God's not gonna let the Gentiles straight-up erase your bros' descendants, no cap.
[1 Nephi 13:32] God won't let the Gentiles stay stuck in that dumb blind spot forever...no cap...just 'cause that ratchet church hid the clearest, most fire parts of the Lamb's gospel you saw.
[1 Nephi 13:33] So the Lamb of God says, "I'm gonna show mercy to the Gentiles when I roll through with serious judgment on Israel's leftover crew."
[1 Nephi 13:34] Then the angel said, "Peep this: after the Lamb visits Israel's leftover fam...your dad's seed...and judges them, smacking them through the Gentiles, and the Gentiles stumble hard 'cause that ratchet church ghosted key gospel parts, the Lamb promises mad mercy on the Gentiles, dropping much of His crystal-clear gospel with His own power."
[1 Nephi 13:35] The Lamb says He'll show up to your fam so they can write lots of fire, clear teachings He drops; but after your fam fades out, losing faith, and your bros' fam too, these truths get tucked away...then later pop off to the Gentiles via the Lamb's power and gift.
[1 Nephi 13:36] The Lamb says His gospel, plus His solid rock and salvation, will be straight-up written in those records.
[1 Nephi 13:37] Mad blessings on those who grind to build my Zion then...they'll flex the Holy Ghost's power; if they hold it down till the end, they'll glow up at last day and vibe forever in the Lamb's kingdom; and anyone dropping peace and hype news? They're gonna be peak aesthetics on the mountains, no cap.
[1 Nephi 13:38] Then I saw the leftover fam of my bros' seed, and the Lamb of God's book that came straight from the Jew's mouth...this book moved from the Gentiles back to my bros' remnant.
[1 Nephi 13:39] After that hit them up, I saw other books roll out by the Lamb's power from the Gentiles to them, flexing receipts to convince Gentiles, my bros' remnant, and scattered Jews worldwide that the prophets' and Lamb's twelve apostles' records are legit.
[1 Nephi 13:40] The angel told me, "These latest records you saw with the Gentiles will back up the OG twelve apostles' truth, spill the tea on the missing key gospel stuff, and flex to every squad, language, and crew that the Lamb of God is the Eternal Father's Son and the world's Savior; everyone's gotta come thru Him or no save, no cap."
[1 Nephi 13:41] They gotta come through the Lamb's word, which gets locked down in your fam's records and the twelve apostles' records...both squad goals in one, 'cause there's one God and one Shepherd running the whole earth.
[1 Nephi 13:42] The time's coming when He'll show up to all nations...Jews and Gentiles alike; after He flexes to both, He'll switch it up, manifesting to Gentiles first and Jews next...last gonna be first and first gonna be last, no cap.
[1 Nephi 14:1] When the Lamb shows up to the Gentiles with words and straight-up power, if they actually listen, He'll take away all their stumbling blocks, no cap.
[1 Nephi 14:2] If they don't harden their hearts against the Lamb, they'll join your dad's squad...straight-up part of Israel's house...and become blessed on the promised land forever, never getting dragged back into captivity or confused again.
[1 Nephi 14:3] That huge trap dug by the mad sus church...the devil and his crew's startup to drag souls to hell...will backfire; those who dug it will fall in deep and get totally destroyed, says the Lamb; not your soul dying, but getting tossed into endless hell, no cap.
[1 Nephi 14:4] This is straight-up the devil's own trap and God's justice squad coming down hard on anyone grinding wickedness and abomination in His face.
[1 Nephi 14:5] The angel slid into my thoughts, Nephi, like "You saw if the Gentiles bounce back and repent, they're straight; you know the Lord's covenants with Israel, and you've heard...anyone who skips repentance gotta perish, no cap."
[1 Nephi 14:6] So low-key, Gentiles, if y'all harden your hearts against the Lamb of God, big woah's coming your way.
[1 Nephi 14:7] The Lamb of God says the time's coming when He'll pull a massive, legendary move on humanity...game-changing forever. It's either gonna convince them to peace and eternal life or send them deep into heart-hardness, mind-blindness, and straight-up captivity and destruction, both IRL and spiritually, all tied to the devil's trap I mentioned.
[1 Nephi 14:8] After the angel dropped those words, he hit me with, "You remember the Father's covenants to Israel's house?" I was like, "Bet, I got that."
[1 Nephi 14:9] Then he was like, "Peep that huge, sus church...the OG of all abominations, founded straight up by the devil himself."
[1 Nephi 14:10] He told me, "Look, there's only two squads: the Lamb of God's church and the devil's crew. So if you ain't with the Lamb's church, you're rolling with that sus mother of all abominations...the whore of the whole earth, no cap."
[1 Nephi 14:11] I peeped the whore of all the earth chillin' on mad waters, flexing her control over every nation, tribe, language, and crew worldwide.
[1 Nephi 14:12] I saw the Lamb of God's church was low-key small 'cause of the whore's wicked vibes ruling those many waters; still, God's saints were everywhere, just with limited clout 'cause of that big sus whore's mess.
[1 Nephi 14:13] I saw the big mom of abominations flexing, pulling huge Gentile crowds from every corner of the earth to beef with the Lamb of God.
[1 Nephi 14:14] I, Nephi, saw the Lamb of God's power drop hard on His saints and covenant crew scattered worldwide, fully flexing with righteousness and God's glory like straight-up legends.
[1 Nephi 14:15] I saw God's wrath get poured all over that huge abominable church, sparking wars and mad rumors of wars popping off across every nation and tribe on earth.
[1 Nephi 14:16] As wars and chatter about wars blew up among the mother of abominations' nations, the angel told me, "Look, God's wrath is on the mother of harlots, and you're catching all this, right?"
[1 Nephi 14:17] When God's wrath finally drops on the mother of harlots...that massive abominable church started by the devil...then the Father's work kicks off, setting the stage to flex His covenants with His Israel crew.
[1 Nephi 14:18] Then the angel hit me with, "Yo, check this out!"
[1 Nephi 14:19] I looked up and saw a dude rocking a fresh white robe, looking hella clean.
[1 Nephi 14:20] The angel was like, "Peep this...one of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, no cap."
[1 Nephi 14:21] Look, he's gonna see and jot down the rest of this stuff, plus a bunch of things that already went down.
[1 Nephi 14:22] He's also gonna spill the tea about how the world's gonna end, no cap.
[1 Nephi 14:23] So, what he writes is straight-up facts, all true, and it's in that book you saw coming from the Jew's mouth...back when the words dropped, everything was clear, pure, and mad easy for anyone to get.
[1 Nephi 14:24] Yo, this apostle of the Lamb is gonna write about a ton of stuff you already peeped, and the rest? You're gonna see that too, no cap.
[1 Nephi 14:25] But the stuff you catch later? Don't even sweat writing it down...God already set the Lamb's apostle to handle that flex.
[1 Nephi 14:26] Plus, God's already shown the receipts to others before, and they wrote 'em down; those truths are sealed tight and will drop pure and fresh when the time's right for the house of Israel.
[1 Nephi 14:27] So yeah, I, Nephi, caught it and can attest...the apostle of the Lamb's name is John, straight from the angel's word.
[1 Nephi 14:28] So, heads up: I, Nephi, got told to chill on writing the rest of what I saw and heard; what I dropped so far is enough, and honestly, that's just a fraction of the whole vibe.
[1 Nephi 14:29] Deadass, I testify I saw the same stuff my dad did, and the Lord's angel low-key spilled the tea to me.
[1 Nephi 14:30] Alright, I'm wrapping up my talk on the visions I had while vibing in the Spirit; if I didn't write everything, trust what I did put down is straight facts. That's facts. Amen.
[1 Nephi 15:1] So after I, Nephi, got totally spun in the Spirit and peeped all this, I bounced back to my dad's tent.
[1 Nephi 15:2] I caught my brothers beefing, arguing about the stuff my dad had just dropped on them.
[1 Nephi 15:3] My dad legit said some deep stuff that's low-key tough to get unless you hit up the Lord for clarity...but these guys were stubborn, so they didn't even bother looking to God like they should.
[1 Nephi 15:4] I, Nephi, was straight-up shook by how stubborn they were, especially knowing from what I saw that all the bad stuff's gonna go down because people are mad wicked, no cap.
[1 Nephi 15:5] I was lowkey overwhelmed by all my struggles, thinking my pain was next level since I'd seen my people's whole downfall coming.
[1 Nephi 15:6] Once I got my strength back, I hit up my brothers asking why they were caught up in all this arguing.
[1 Nephi 15:7] They said, "Bruh, we can't vibe with what Dad said about the natural olive tree branches and the whole Gentiles situation."
[1 Nephi 15:8] I hit them with, "Yo, did you even slide into the Lord's DMs for answers?"
[1 Nephi 15:9] They hit me back, "Nah, we haven't...God hasn't dropped any receipts or vibes on that to us."
[1 Nephi 15:10] I was like, "Fr, how are y'all not keeping God's rules? Y'all dragging your own downfall with that stubborn heart energy?"
[1 Nephi 15:11] Didn't y'all catch what God said? If you don't flex that stubbornness and actually ask Him with faith, grinding on His commandments, He'll low-key spill the tea to you for real.
[1 Nephi 15:12] Listen up, fam...the Spirit told Dad Israel's like an olive tree, and we low-key got broken off from that tree, but we still branches of the same house.
[1 Nephi 15:13] So Dad's point about natural branches getting grafted back through the Gentiles' full-on wave? Basically, in the last days, when our peeps slack off on faith for hella years after Messiah shows up in person, the gospel's gonna hit the Gentiles full blast, then bounce back to our leftover fam.
[1 Nephi 15:14] On that day, our leftover fam will finally get that they're straight-up from Israel's house, God's chosen squad; they'll catch on about their ancestors and the gospel their Redeemer dropped on their forefathers, so they can learn His main vibes and how to link up with Him for salvation.
[1 Nephi 15:15] Bet on it, on that day they'll be hyped, throwing mad praise to their forever God...their solid rock and savior. They'll get their power and fuel from the real vine and pull up to God's legit squad.
[1 Nephi 15:16] Yo, for real...they'll get clout again with Israel, getting grafted back as legit natural branches into the real olive tree.
[1 Nephi 15:17] This is what Dad meant: it won't pop off until after the Gentiles scatter them, and it's through the Gentiles that the Lord flexes His power...mostly cause the Jews, Israel's house, gonna ghost Him first.
[1 Nephi 15:18] So Dad wasn't just talking about our crew, but the whole house of Israel, pointing to that big covenant that'll pop off in the last days...God told Abraham straight up: through your seed, every squad on Earth gets blessed.
[1 Nephi 15:19] So I, Nephi, kept hitting them with the facts about this stuff, especially the Jews making a comeback in the last days...say less.
[1 Nephi 15:20] I dropped Isaiah's words on them...talking 'bout the Jews, the house of Israel, getting restored, no more getting clowned or scattered again. After all that, my bros chilled out and got low-key humble before the Lord.
[1 Nephi 15:21] Then they hit me up like, "Yo, what's the tea on that dream Dad had? What's up with that tree he saw?"
[1 Nephi 15:22] I told them straight up: that tree? It's a flex representing the tree of life.
[1 Nephi 15:23] They were like, "Yo, what's up with that iron rod Dad peeped that's guiding to the tree?"
[1 Nephi 15:24] I said, that iron rod is God's word; anyone who vibes with it and holds tight won't flop or get played by the devil's sus tricks that try to blind and wreck them.
[1 Nephi 15:25] So, me, Nephi, I went all in, hyping them hard to pay attention to God's word, pouring every ounce of my soul and brainpower into making sure they never forget to stick to His commandments 24/7.
[1 Nephi 15:26] They hit me with, "What's the deal with that river our dad saw in the dream?"
[1 Nephi 15:27] I told them that river? It's straight-up filthiness, but Dad was so distracted he didn't even peep how nasty the water was.
[1 Nephi 15:28] I let them know that river's like a savage gap, keeping the wicked blocked from the tree of life and God's squad.
[1 Nephi 15:29] I told them it's basically a symbol of straight-up hell, like the angel told me...reserved for the wicked, no cap.
[1 Nephi 15:30] I told them Dad also saw God's justice splitting wicked from righteous...the glow so lit it's like eternal flames shooting up to God, no chill, forever and ever.
[1 Nephi 15:31] They asked me, "Yo, is this about the body's pain while we got this probation time, or the soul's final vibe after death, or is it just talking temporary stuff?"
[1 Nephi 15:32] So, I explained it stands for both the here-and-now and the spiritual side; the day's gonna come when everyone's judged on their deeds...yes, even what their body pulled during probation.
[1 Nephi 15:33] So, if they die stuck in wickedness, they get ghosted from spiritual stuff tied to righteousness; they'll stand before God for judgment, and if their deeds are trash, they gotta be trash too...meaning no way they roll up in God's kingdom, or else God's kingdom would be sus too.
[1 Nephi 15:34] But real talk, God's kingdom ain't dirty, and no sketchy or unclean thing gets in; so there's gotta be a spot reserved for all the nasty stuff.
[1 Nephi 15:35] There's a spot ready, yeah, that terrible hell I mentioned, and the devil's the one who set it up; so in the end, souls either vibe in God's kingdom or get straight-up booted 'cause of that justice I talked about.
[1 Nephi 15:36] So yeah, the wicked get dumped from the righteous and shut out from that tree of life...the fruit's the ultimate flex, the top-tier gift from God. That's what I told my squad. Amen.
[1 Nephi 16:1] After I, Nephi, finished dropping knowledge to my bros, they hit me with, "Bruh, you just hit us with way too much heavy stuff...we can't even handle it."
[1 Nephi 16:2] I told them straight up, yeah I came hard on the wicked 'cause that's facts; I hyped the righteous too, saying they'll flex in the final day; so the guilty vibe hard when truth hits 'em deep in the feels.
[1 Nephi 16:3] Yo, if y'all were righteous and down to actually listen and act on the truth to walk right with God, you wouldn't be whining saying, "You're throwing shade at us."
[1 Nephi 16:4] So I, Nephi, was grinding hard, pushing my bros nonstop to stick to the Lord's commandments...no cap.
[1 Nephi 16:5] They finally humbled up before the Lord, and low-key it gave me mad joy and hope they'd actually stick to the righteous path.
[1 Nephi 16:6] All this talk and action went down while my dad was chillin' in a tent in that valley he named Lemuel.
[1 Nephi 16:7] So I, Nephi, married one of Ishmael's daughters, my bros did the same, and even Zoram snagged the eldest daughter for his wife...say less.
[1 Nephi 16:8] So my dad checked off every Lord command like a pro, and I, Nephi, got mad blessed by God...exceedingly, no cap.
[1 Nephi 16:9] Late at night, the Lord hit my dad up, telling him to bounce into the wilderness first thing tomorrow.
[1 Nephi 16:10] So my dad gets up, steps out the tent, and low-key freaks seeing this shiny brass ball on the ground with two spindles inside...one was pointing exactly where we had to bounce into the wilderness.
[1 Nephi 16:11] We packed up all the essentials and extra provisions the Lord hooked us with, plus seeds of every type, ready to flex survival mode in the wilderness.
[1 Nephi 16:12] We grabbed our tents and dipped into the wilderness, crossing the river Laman like it was no big deal.
[1 Nephi 16:13] We trekked four days almost south-southeast, then set up camp and dubbed the spot Shazer...say less.
[1 Nephi 16:14] We grabbed bows and arrows, went hunting to feed the fam, then bounced back to Shazer; we kept grinding in the wilderness, sticking to the lush spots near the Red Sea borders...no cap.
[1 Nephi 16:15] For days on end, we traveled wildin', hunting food on the fly using bows, arrows, stones, and slings...straight survival flex.
[1 Nephi 16:16] We vibed with the ball's GPS, guiding us straight to the greenest, most clutch spots in the wilderness.
[1 Nephi 16:17] After grinding through many days, we set up tents to chill and rest up, plus stock food for the fam squad.
[1 Nephi 16:18] So I'm out hunting, flexing my steel bow, when it snaps...big L...and my bros started mad salty at me 'cause now we got zero food.
[1 Nephi 16:19] We rolled back empty-handed and beat, and the fam was straight struggling from the hunger and the rough trek.
[1 Nephi 16:20] Laman, Lemuel, and Ishmael's crew started majorly whining about the wilderness struggle, and even Pops threw shade at God...everyone was super salty and low-key mad at the Lord.
[1 Nephi 16:21] Low-key stressed 'cause my bow broke and my bros' bows were busted too, hunting turned super sus...no food coming through at all.
[1 Nephi 16:22] I, Nephi, had to hit my brothers with some real talk 'cause they were straight up hardening their hearts and throwing mad shade at God again.
[1 Nephi 16:23] I, Nephi, crafted a wooden bow and a straight-stick arrow, strapped up with sling and stones, then hit up Dad like, "Yo, where's the move to get food?"
[1 Nephi 16:24] Dad checked in with the Lord since we'd finally humbled up after my real-deal soul talks that hit hard.
[1 Nephi 16:25] Then God's voice tapped Dad, and he got majorly humble, feeling all the guilt for whining against the Lord...straight deep in the feels.
[1 Nephi 16:26] God's voice told him, "Peep the ball and check out the messages written on it."
[1 Nephi 16:27] When Dad scoped the writings on the ball, he got mad shook, trembling hard...same with my bros, Ishmael's sons, and the wifeys.
[1 Nephi 16:28] I, Nephi, peeped the pointers in the ball and saw they only flexed when we brought faith, grind, and straight-up attention.
[1 Nephi 16:29] There was new text popping up clear as day, schooling us on God's moves, switching up based on the faith and hustle we showed; proves the Lord pulls big flexes through small vibes.
[1 Nephi 16:30] So I, Nephi, bounced up the mountain peak, following the GPS vibes from the ball's directions.
[1 Nephi 16:31] I went full beast mode hunting wild animals and secured the bag...food for all our fams, no cap.
[1 Nephi 16:32] I rolled back to camp flexing the beasts I bagged; seeing the food, their joy hit peak mode, and they low-key humbled and thanked the Lord big time.
[1 Nephi 16:33] We hit the road again, sticking close to the OG route; after mad days on the grind, we dropped tents to chill for a bit.
[1 Nephi 16:34] Ishmael passed away and got laid to rest in a spot called Nahom, no cap.
[1 Nephi 16:35] Ishmael's daughters were straight-up sobbing hard over losing their dad and the wilderness struggle; they side-eyed my dad for dragging them from Jerusalem, whining, "Our dad's gone, we've been lost and starving, and now we're about to die out here...big yikes."
[1 Nephi 16:36] So they threw shade at my dad and me, low-key wanting to bounce back to Jerusalem like it was all good.
[1 Nephi 16:37] Laman was like, "Yo Lemuel and Ishmael's sons, bet we off our dad and Nephi too...dude's acting all bossy like our ruler and teacher, even though we're older."
[1 Nephi 16:38] Laman claimed God and angels slid into his DMs, but we know he's cap; he's playing mind games to fool us, hoping to drag us into some random wilderness and crown himself king to boss us around...classic Laman stirring the pot big time.
[1 Nephi 16:39] The Lord rolled up on us, dropped serious words that roasted them hard; after getting that divine wake-up call, they cooled their rage and got right with God, so He blessed us with food and kept us from biting the dust.
[1 Nephi 17:1] We hit the trail again, heading mostly east, grinding through all kinds of wilderness drama, and even our women were out here popping out babies mid-journey.
[1 Nephi 17:2] God's blessings were so real that even while we were munching raw meat in the wild, the women were out here nursing their kids like champs, tough as the dudes, and stopped whining about the trek.
[1 Nephi 17:3] Bottom line: God's commandments gotta be followed; if people keep them, He's out here fueling them up, giving strength, and hooking up the resources to get the job done...so He made sure we had what we needed during our wilderness grind.
[1 Nephi 17:4] We were basically living that wilderness life for mad years...eight whole years stuck in the grind.
[1 Nephi 17:5] We rolled up to a spot we named Bountiful 'cause it was loaded with fruit and wild honey...God hooked that up so we wouldn't die out; then we peeped the sea, calling it Irreantum, which means many waters, no cap.
[1 Nephi 17:6] We set up camp by the shore, and even though we'd been through mad struggles too wild to even write out, pulling up to the sea got us hyped AF, so we named the spot Bountiful for all the fruit vibes.
[1 Nephi 17:7] After chilling in Bountiful for a minute, the Lord hit me up saying, "Get up and head to the mountain." So I bounced up there and hollered at God, no cap.
[1 Nephi 17:8] Then the Lord dropped the blueprint, saying, "Build a ship exactly like I show you, so I can get your crew across these waters, no cap."
[1 Nephi 17:9] I was like, "Lord, where do I even find ore to melt down so I can make the tools to build this ship you showed me?"
[1 Nephi 17:10] Then the Lord straight-up told me where to cop the ore so I could craft the tools, no cap.
[1 Nephi 17:11] So I, Nephi, rigged up a bellows from animal skins to keep the fire lit, then smashed two stones together to spark that flame, say less.
[1 Nephi 17:12] God hadn't let us cook much fire before while trekking the wilderness, saying, "I'll make your food taste sweet even without cooking," low-key miraculous.
[1 Nephi 17:13] I'll be your spotlight in the wilderness and clear the path if y'all stick to my commandments; so, keep my rules and you'll vibe your way to the promised land...and trust, you'll know it's all me guiding you.
[1 Nephi 17:14] The Lord said straight up: once you're in the promised land, you'll low-key realize I'm God, and that I rescued you from destruction and hauled you outta Jerusalem.
[1 Nephi 17:15] So me, Nephi, I was grinding hard to keep God's commandments and kept hyping up my bros to stay faithful and hustle nonstop.
[1 Nephi 17:16] I went full DIY and made tools from ore I melted straight outta the rock, no cap.
[1 Nephi 17:17] When my bros peeped I was starting on the ship, they low-key roasted me, saying, "Our dude's a clown thinking he can build a ship and sail across these massive waters."
[1 Nephi 17:18] So my bros kept whining, dodging work 'cause they didn't buy that I could build the ship or that God was even giving me the playbook.
[1 Nephi 17:19] I, Nephi, got mad sad 'cause my bros were so stubborn, and when they saw me feeling down, they low-key celebrated, flexing, "We knew you couldn't build a ship...your judgment's trash, no way you pull off something this big."
[1 Nephi 17:20] They said, "You're just like Dad, caught up in dumb daydreams; he dragged us outta Jerusalem, and we've been lost in the wilderness for years, our pregnant women grinding hard, giving birth while struggling nonstop...honestly, it might've been less brutal if they'd died before leaving Jerusalem."
[1 Nephi 17:21] They've been like, "Bro, we've been stuck suffering in the wilderness all these years when we could've been chilling with our stuff and inherited land, basically living that happy life."
[1 Nephi 17:22] They kept flexing, "The Jerusalem peeps were righteous, sticking to God's laws and Moses' rules; Dad judged them and hauled us out 'cause we'd listen to him, and our brother's just like him." That's how my bros kept throwing shade and whining at us.
[1 Nephi 17:23] So I, Nephi, hit them with, "Do y'all really think our Israelite ancestors bounced from Egypt without vibing with God's commands?"
[1 Nephi 17:24] Like fr, would they have escaped slavery if God hadn't told Moses to boss up and lead them out? Say less.
[1 Nephi 17:25] You already know the Israelites were straight-up slaves, stuck with mad heavy tasks, so no cap, escaping that bondage was a whole W for them.
[1 Nephi 17:26] You know Moses got the divine go-ahead to do the big move, and he straight-up split the Red Sea so they could walk through dry land, no cap.
[1 Nephi 17:27] But no cap, Pharaoh's army got soaked and drowned in the Red Sea...big L for them.
[1 Nephi 17:28] And y'all know they got that manna drip in the wilderness to keep them fed, no cap.
[1 Nephi 17:29] For real, Moses, powered by God, smacked that rock and water busted out so the Israelites could stay hydrated...big mood.
[1 Nephi 17:30] Even with God leading the way, lighting their path day and night, doing all the necessary moves for them, they still hard-bricked their hearts, went full sus on Moses and the one true God.
[1 Nephi 17:31] So, on His word, He clapped those haters, led His people, and handled everything...nothing happened without His command, no cap.
[1 Nephi 17:32] After crossing the Jordan, God powered them up to flex on the locals, straight-up scattering their squads into destruction.
[1 Nephi 17:33] So, you really think the locals kicked out by our ancestors in the promised land were all saints? Nah, I'm telling you, big nope.
[1 Nephi 17:34] You really think our ancestors would've been upgraded if they were any more righteous? Nah fam, that's a hard nope.
[1 Nephi 17:35] God vibes with all flesh equally; whoever's righteous gets His favor. But this crew ghosted every word from God, maxed out on sin, so His wrath was full-on. He cursed the land on them, blessed it to our dads, cursing them to destruction and handing power over the land to our fam.
[1 Nephi 17:36] God made the earth to be lived on, and He made His kids to own it...say less.
[1 Nephi 17:37] He flexes by raising up a righteous squad and yeets the wicked nations...no cap.
[1 Nephi 17:38] He guides the righteous crew to lit lands, while wiping out the wicked and cursing the land on them...big savage energy.
[1 Nephi 17:39] He's the ultimate boss chilling in the heavens...His throne...and the earth's just His footstool, no cap.
[1 Nephi 17:40] God's ride-or-die with anyone who chooses Him, no cap. He loved our ancestors...Abraham, Isaac, Jacob...and kept His promises, pulling them outta Egypt like a boss.
[1 Nephi 17:41] God clapped them hard in the wilderness 'cause they threw shade and hardened their hearts like y'all do. He unleashed fiery serpents for real, but then made a low-key heal move...just gotta look to get fixed. Still, tons dipped 'cause they couldn't handle the simple fix, fr fr.
[1 Nephi 17:42] They kept toughening their hearts, throwing shade at Moses and God, but no cap, they were still flexed out by His unmatched power into the promised land.
[1 Nephi 17:43] After all that, they've gone full wicked, like ripe for disaster, and low-key, they might be about to get wiped out now. I'm sure the day's coming when they get yeeted, except for a few who get dragged into captivity.
[1 Nephi 17:44] So, God told my dad to bounce into the wilderness, but the Jews tried to off him; and y'all low-key tried too...deadass, murderers in your hearts, basically twins with them.
[1 Nephi 17:45] Y'all quick to mess up but slow to remember God. You've seen an angel and heard him talk, even in that low-key whisper vibe, but you were so numb you couldn't feel it; so He had to hit you like thunder, shaking the earth like it's finna split.
[1 Nephi 17:46] You know God's almighty word can make the earth disappear or flip rough spots smooth and smooth spots rough. So, fr fr, why y'all still so stubborn-hearted?
[1 Nephi 17:47] Low-key, my soul's torn up 'cause of y'all, heart hurting bad; I'm scared you'll get ghosted forever. I'm so packed with God's Spirit, I'm straight weak in the knees.
[1 Nephi 17:48] So I dropped these words and they got mad, tryna throw me deep in the sea; but I clapped back, "In God's name, don't touch me...I'm powered up so hard it's burning me up inside. Anyone who tries will shrivel like a dry reed and be nothing against God's power. God'll clap back hard."
[1 Nephi 17:49] So I, Nephi, told them to stop whining about their dad and quit slackin' on me, 'cause God straight-up ordered me to build a ship...say less.
[1 Nephi 17:50] I told them, if God's got me on a mission, I can handle it all. If He told me to make this water turn to earth, boom, it'd flip just like that...no cap.
[1 Nephi 17:51] So like, if God's flexing that crazy power and pulling mad miracles for humans, why can't He just give me the blueprint to build a ship? Bet.
[1 Nephi 17:52] I, Nephi, kept dropping truth bombs so hard my bros were shook and couldn't clap back; they didn't even dare lay a finger on me for days, scared they'd wither like dead leaves...God's Spirit was straight-up flexing on them.
[1 Nephi 17:53] Then the Lord told me, "Reach out to your bros again; they won't shrivel this time, but I'll hit them with a shock...so they gotta know I'm the real deal, their God."
[1 Nephi 17:54] So I reached out to my bros, and they didn't shrivel up; instead, God straight shook them down just like He said He would.
[1 Nephi 17:55] They were like, "We for sure know God's got your back, 'cause His power shook us hard." Then they tried to worship me, but I shut that down, saying, "Yo, I'm your brother...your younger bro even. Worship God instead and respect your parents, so you can vibe long on the land God's giving you."
[1 Nephi 18:1] They started worshipping God and rolled with me, grinding on crafting timbers with some seriously next-level skills, while God kept dropping hints on how to build the ship right.
[1 Nephi 18:2] Yo, I, Nephi, didn't build the ship like some basic human DIY project; nah, I followed God's exclusive blueprint, so this ship was straight-up God-level, not human-style.
[1 Nephi 18:3] I, Nephi, hit the mountain a lot and prayed nonstop, so God came through with some mad visions and big reveals.
[1 Nephi 18:4] When I finished the ship just like God said, my bros saw it was straight fire and the craftsmanship was next level, so they humbled up and gave God mad props again.
[1 Nephi 18:5] Then God hit my dad with a voice like, "Get up, fam, time to roll down into the ship."
[1 Nephi 18:6] Next day, after stocking up mad fruits, meat, honey, and supplies like God said, we all rolled into the ship...everyone with their gear, wives, kids, and seeds, each according to their age.
[1 Nephi 18:7] So, my dad had two sons out in the wilderness: the older named Jacob and the younger, Joseph.
[1 Nephi 18:8] After we all boarded the ship with our supplies, just like God said, we set sail and the wind pushed us straight toward the promised land, no cap.
[1 Nephi 18:9] After cruising with the wind for days, my bros, Ishmael's fam, and their wives got hella lit...dancing, singing, acting mad extra, totally ghosting the fact God's power got us here; their attitude got straight-up sus.
[1 Nephi 18:10] I, Nephi, low-key freaked out thinking God might clap back on us for our mess and sink us, so I tried to keep it real and warn them, but they got salty, saying, "No way our little bro's running the show."
[1 Nephi 18:11] So Laman and Lemuel straight-up cuffed me with ropes and treated me mad rough, but God let it slide to flex His power and make His prophecy about the wicked come true.
[1 Nephi 18:12] Once they had me all tied up tight, the compass God set up straight-up stopped working, no cap.
[1 Nephi 18:13] So they had zero clue where to steer, and a savage storm blew up, tossing us around for three days straight; everyone was shook about drowning, yet they still kept me strapped down.
[1 Nephi 18:14] By day four of getting tossed back, the storm went full savage mode, no chill at all.
[1 Nephi 18:15] We were about to get straight-up swallowed by the deep sea after four days of chaos; my bros finally caught that God's wrath was real and they'd be toast unless they repented, so they unchained my wrists...which were mad swollen...plus my ankles were hurtin' big time.
[1 Nephi 18:16] Even with all that pain, I kept my eyes on God, praised Him nonstop all day, and never threw shade or complained about my struggles.
[1 Nephi 18:17] My dad, Lehi, dropped mad knowledge to them and Ishmael's crew, but they threw major shade and threats at anyone siding with me; my parents, old and stressed from the drama, ended up wiped out, stuck in bed sick.
[1 Nephi 18:18] Their grief and my bros' wild sin had my parents so drained they were almost carried off to meet God, their gray hairs close to dust, basically ready to be shoved into a watery grave from all the sorrow.
[1 Nephi 18:19] Even young Jacob and Joseph, needing care, were bummed out over their mom's struggles; my wife cried and prayed hard, and my kids too, but none of it softened my bros' cold hearts enough to untie me.
[1 Nephi 18:20] Nothing but God's power threatening total wipeout could crack their tough vibes; so when they saw they were about to get swallowed by the sea, they finally repented and unchained me.
[1 Nephi 18:21] Once they untied me, I grabbed the compass and it vibed exactly where I wanted; I prayed to God, and boom...the winds and storm dipped, leaving mad calm all around.
[1 Nephi 18:22] So yeah, I, Nephi, took the helm and we cruised straight back on track toward the promised land, no cap.
[1 Nephi 18:23] After sailing mad days, we finally landed in the promised land, set up camp, and officially called it that...say less.
[1 Nephi 18:24] We started grinding, planting all the seeds we hauled from Jerusalem, and low-key, they popped off big time...so yeah, we got blessed with mad abundance.
[1 Nephi 18:25] As we roamed the promised land, we found forests packed with every beast...cows, oxen, donkeys, horses, goats, wild goats, you name it...all legit for people's use; plus, we scored all kinds of ore: gold, silver, and copper on deck.
[1 Nephi 19:1] God told me to make metal plates, so I engraved my people's story...my dad's record, our wilderness trek, his prophecies, plus my own future visions all locked in there.
[1 Nephi 19:2] Low-key, when I made those plates I didn't know God was gonna order me to do it; so my dad's story, his fam tree, and most of our wilderness saga got etched on those OG plates, making them the real receipts for what went down before I even started.
[1 Nephi 19:3] After making those plates 'cause God said so, I, Nephi, got told to put the ministry and the clearest prophecies on there too ... all for schooling my peeps who'd own the land and other low-key divine reasons only God fully gets.
[1 Nephi 19:4] So I, Nephi, went ahead and made another set of plates that spill the tea on our wars, fights, and chaos way more in-depth; I set up the plan for my fam to pass these plates down prophet-to-prophet through the generations, till God says otherwise.
[1 Nephi 19:5] The full story of me making these plates will drop later; for now, I'm sticking to the plan to keep the sacred stuff locked down for my people's knowledge, no cap.
[1 Nephi 19:6] Real talk, I only jot down what I believe is sacred; if I mess up, yeah, even the OGs slipped too...but I'm not making excuses for them, just keeping it 100 about my own human flaws.
[1 Nephi 19:7] Stuff some folks hype as mad important...for body and soul...others straight-up disregard and step on; yeah, even the God of Israel gets that energy...people lowkey ignore Him and ghost His advice like it's nothing.
[1 Nephi 19:8] Yo, check it...like the angel said, He's gonna roll up 600 years after my dad bounced from Jerusalem, no cap.
[1 Nephi 19:9] The world's gonna call Him irrelevant 'cause of their sins, and they'll beat Him down; He takes all the hits, even the spitting, just 'cause He's mad patient and loves humanity hard.
[1 Nephi 19:10] The God of our ancestors...Abraham, Isaac, Jacob...the same who freed them from Egypt and kept them safe in the wild, low-key surrenders as a man into wicked hands, gets lifted up and crucified like Zenock and Neum said, then gets buried as Zenos predicted, with three days of darkness as the death sign for island dwellers, especially Israel's fam.
[1 Nephi 19:11] The prophet said straight up: God's gonna hit up all Israel that day...some will vibe with His voice 'cause they're righteous, catching mad joy and salvation, but others get the full power flex: thunder, lightning, storms, fire, smoke, darkness, the earth opening up, and mountains moving like wild.
[1 Nephi 19:12] Prophet Zenos didn't play...said all this gotta happen for real: the earth's rocks will split, and the groaning soil will hit kings of the sea isles so hard the Spirit makes them shout, "The God of nature's finally feeling the pain."
[1 Nephi 19:13] And for the Jerusalem crew, the prophet says everybody's gonna roast them 'cause they nailed the God of Israel and straight-up bounced on Him...ignoring all the signs, wonders, and His full power flex.
[1 Nephi 19:14] The prophet says since they ghosted their hearts and dissed Israel's Holy One, they'll roam lost in the flesh, end up wiped out, turned into a meme of shame, and get lowkey hated by all nations.
[1 Nephi 19:15] But the prophet's like, when that day hits and they finally stop ghosting their hearts on Israel's Holy One, He'll slide back through and remember the covenants He made with their ancestors.
[1 Nephi 19:16] For real, then He'll remember the sea isles and gather up all Israel's peeps from every corner of the earth, just like prophet Zenos said, God's promise no cap.
[1 Nephi 19:17] Straight up, the prophet says the whole world's gonna peep the Lord's salvation, and every nation, fam, language, and squad will catch those blessings.
[1 Nephi 19:18] So yeah, I'm Nephi, dropping these words to my crew, hoping to rizz them into remembering the Lord, their main Redeemer.
[1 Nephi 19:19] So, I'm talking to all Israel's squad, if they end up catching these truths, say less.
[1 Nephi 19:20] For real, I'm shook in the spirit, my whole body's weak thinking about Jerusalem's crew; if God hadn't been merciful and dropped visions on me like back in the day with old prophets, I'd be done for too.
[1 Nephi 19:21] God legit showed all the deets about them to old-school prophets, and also gave visions about us; so obviously we gotta know 'bout them since it's all recorded on the plates of brass, no cap.
[1 Nephi 19:22] So I, Nephi, schooled my brothers on this stuff, reading straight from the plates of brass to show them how the Lord was flexin' back in the day with folks from other lands.
[1 Nephi 19:23] I read my bros mad stuff from Moses' books, but to hit harder and get them to vibe with the Lord their Redeemer, I pulled up Isaiah's words and linked all scriptures to our situation for max learning and gain.
[1 Nephi 19:24] So I told them, listen up, leftover fam of Israel, a branch that got snipped off; peep the prophet's words meant for all Israel and relate 'em to yourselves so you catch the same hope your OG brethren got before the cut ... that's how the prophet rolled.
[1 Nephi 20:1] Yo, house of Jacob repping Israel, fresh out the waters of Judah or baptism, flexing the Lord's name and shouting God of Israel, but low-key their oaths lack realness and righteous receipts.
[1 Nephi 20:2] They claim they're from the holy city, but low-key they ain't leaning on the God of Israel, the real Lord of Hosts...yeah, that's His legit name, no cap.
[1 Nephi 20:3] Look, I dropped the OG stuff from day one straight from my mouth, and I hit them with the reveal...no cap, it was sudden and clear.
[1 Nephi 20:4] I did it 'cause I knew you're stubborn as hell, with a neck tougher than iron and a brow harder than brass...no chill.
[1 Nephi 20:5] From the jump, I spilled the tea before it even happened, showing it all to keep you from flexing like, "My idol pulled this off, my carved or melted statue called the shots."
[1 Nephi 20:6] You've peeped and heard all this...so you gonna spill it or nah? I even dropped fresh, low-key secrets you didn't know before.
[1 Nephi 20:7] These things just got created, not OG, and before you even heard 'em, I already revealed 'em so you can't front and say, "Yeah, I knew that."
[1 Nephi 20:8] Yeah, you didn't hear or know jack then; your ear was straight up closed, 'cause I knew you'd be mad sus, breaking rules from the jump, even before you were born.
[1 Nephi 20:9] Still, for the rep of my name, I'm holding back the rage and chilling on you so I don't cancel you for good.
[1 Nephi 20:10] Look, I've been grinding you like ore, picked you out through the heat of tough times, no cap.
[1 Nephi 20:11] For my own sake, straight up, I'm doing this...I ain't letting my name get dragged nor handing my clout to anyone else, say less.
[1 Nephi 20:12] Yo Jacob and Israel, my chosen crew, listen up...I'm the real deal, first in the game and last to dip, no cap.
[1 Nephi 20:13] My hand built the earth's base, my right hand stretched the skies, and I called them up...they showed up squad deep, no flex.
[1 Nephi 20:14] Yo, gather 'round and listen up...who else dropped these truths? The Lord's got mad love for him, and he'll keep his promises, flexing hard on Babylon and coming through strong on the Chaldeans.
[1 Nephi 20:15] The Lord says, "I'm the one who spoke up, called him to drop the word, brought him through, and he's gonna have mad success."
[1 Nephi 20:16] Pull up close, I ain't been whispering or low-key...since day one, I've been speaking out; the Lord God and His Spirit sent me on this mission.
[1 Nephi 20:17] The Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, says: I sent him...your God who schools you in the glow-up, guiding your path like a true MVP, and he's got it done.
[1 Nephi 20:18] If only you'd actually listened to my rules, your peace would flow steady like a river, and your goodness would roll deep like ocean waves, no cap.
[1 Nephi 20:19] Your fam would've been straight-up countless like sand, your kids like gravel, and their names wouldn't get erased or ghosted from my sight.
[1 Nephi 20:20] Bounce from Babylon, dip from the Chaldeans, and blast it loud with hype vibes...spread the word to the ends of the earth: The Lord just redeemed His servant Jacob, no cap.
[1 Nephi 20:21] They weren't thirsty; He guided them through the deserts, made water burst from rock like a boss, cracked that rock open and the water just came flooding, no cap.
[1 Nephi 20:22] Even after pulling off all that...and more...the Lord says the wicked ain't gonna catch any peace, straight up.
[1 Nephi 21:1] Listen up, house of Israel ... all y'all cut off and exiled 'cause the pastors went full sus; scattered but still mine, hear this. Isles and distant peeps, the Lord called me from the womb, straight OG from my mama's insides.
[1 Nephi 21:2] He turned my mouth into a sharp sword flex; tucked me in the shade of His hand, polished me up like a sleek arrow, and stashed me in His quiver, ready to go.
[1 Nephi 21:3] He told me straight up: You're my servant, Israel, the one I'm gonna flex through.
[1 Nephi 21:4] So I was like, I've been grinding for nothing, flexing my energy with zero L's, but for real, my judgment's locked with the Lord, and my hustle's with my God.
[1 Nephi 21:5] Now check this, says the Lord who made me from the womb to serve Him and bring Jacob back... even if Israel's still scattered, I'll flex big time in God's eyes, and He's my power source.
[1 Nephi 21:6] He said, serving me to hype up Jacob's tribes and restore Israel's chosen? That's just the warm-up. I'm also making you a spotlight for the Gentiles, bringing salvation vibes to the ends of the earth.
[1 Nephi 21:7] The Lord, Israel's Redeemer and Holy One, says to the one humans lowkey hate and nations side-eye, even the rulers' servant...kings will get up and princes will bow down, all 'cause the Lord's got that unshakeable loyalty.
[1 Nephi 21:8] The Lord says: At the perfect moment, I heard you, isles of the sea, and on salvation-day, I came through; I'll keep you safe and send my servant as the people's promise to set up the earth and reclaim the empty lands.
[1 Nephi 21:9] So you can tell the prisoners, "Go free," and those stuck in the dark, "Come out." They'll feast on the open road, grazing high up where the views slap.
[1 Nephi 21:10] No cap, they won't ever be starving or thirsty, and the sun's heat won't roast them; mercy-led, they'll be guided straight to fresh water spots.
[1 Nephi 21:11] I'm turning all my mountains into pathways, and my highways are gonna be straight-up elevated.
[1 Nephi 21:12] Yo, house of Israel, watch out...folk will roll in from way far off, like from the north, the west, and even the land of Sinim.
[1 Nephi 21:13] Yo heavens, vibe up and sing; earth, get hyped...those from the east are settling in for good. Mountains, drop the fire tracks...no more hits for them; the Lord's got mad love, comforting and showing mercy to his crew going through it.
[1 Nephi 21:14] But check Zion, she's out here saying, "God ghosted me, my Lord forgot me"...but nah, He's about to prove that's straight sus.
[1 Nephi 21:15] Like, can a mom forget her own baby? Nah, even if she did, I won't forget you, house of Israel...no cap, my compassion's on point forever.
[1 Nephi 21:16] Look, I've literally etched you on my hands, and your walls are always front and center in my mind.
[1 Nephi 21:17] Your kids will speed up on those who tried to wreck you, and the ones who left you broken? They're bouncing out of your spot.
[1 Nephi 21:18] Look around...everyone's pulling up and rolling your way. No cap, God says you'll rock them all like drippy bling, wrapped up tight like a bride's fit.
[1 Nephi 21:19] Your empty, wasted spots and wrecked lands are gonna be packed tight with people; and those who tried to devour you? They'll be ghosting miles away.
[1 Nephi 21:20] The kids you get after losing the first batch will be shouting, "This spot's too cramped, make room for me to chill!" in your ears, no cap.
[1 Nephi 21:21] Then you'll be like, low-key confused: "Who even had these kids when I lost my others, stuck lonely like a captive always on the move? And where did these even pop up from? I was solo af."
[1 Nephi 21:22] God's like, "Watch, I'm raising my hand to the Gentiles, waving my flag high; they'll carry your sons in their arms and hoist your daughters on their shoulders."
[1 Nephi 21:23] Kings gonna be your hype dads, queens your hype moms; they'll bow so deep they're basically licking dust off your feet. You'll know it's the Lord's move 'cause those who wait on Him ain't ever embarrassed, bet.
[1 Nephi 21:24] Yo, does the savage lose his catch? Or do the rightful captives break free? Nah, no way.
[1 Nephi 21:25] But God's like, even the mighty's captives get snatched back, and the savage's loot gets freed; I'm beefing with anyone beefing with you, and I'm saving your kids, no cap.
[1 Nephi 21:26] I'll serve up those who bully you with their own grind; they'll get wasted on their own blood like it's prime wine. Everyone's gonna realize I, the Lord, am your Savior and the Mighty One of Jacob, no cap.
[1 Nephi 22:1] So, after I, Nephi, peeped the brass plates, my bros rolled up and hit me with, "Yo, what's the tea on this? Are these vibes spiritual stuff going down in the spirit world, not just flesh things?"
[1 Nephi 22:2] I told them straight: The prophet got the scoop from the Spirit's voice; the Spirit drops all the tea to prophets about what's gonna hit the people in real life.
[1 Nephi 22:3] So yeah, the stuff I read is both real-world and spiritual vibes; looks like the house of Israel's gonna get spread out all over the globe, no cap, hitting every nation eventually.
[1 Nephi 22:4] Low-key, a bunch already ghosted from the squad in Jerusalem; most tribes got led off and scattered all over the sea's islands, and honestly, no one's got receipts on where they ended up...just know they dipped.
[1 Nephi 22:5] Since they got led off, prophecies hit about them and anyone else scattered later, who'll get sus and confused 'cause they'll ghost the Holy One of Israel, hardening their hearts...so they get tossed among all nations and end up straight-up hated by everyone.
[1 Nephi 22:6] But after the Gentiles vibe with and care for them, and God's waving His hand high, setting the Gentiles up as a flag, carrying their kids and daughters proudly, these are real-world moves...part of God's promises to our ancestors, applying to us and all our Israel fam in the days ahead.
[1 Nephi 22:7] This means that once the whole house of Israel is scattered and shook, God's gonna flex by raising a powerhouse nation among the Gentiles right here on this land; through them, our people will spread out everywhere.
[1 Nephi 22:8] After our seed gets scattered, God's gonna pull off some next-level moves with the Gentiles that'll seriously bless our people...like being fed and carried around by the Gentiles, no cap.
[1 Nephi 22:9] This move ain't just clutch for the Gentiles but for the whole house of Israel too, 'cause it spreads the word on God's covenants with Abraham...telling us all that through his seed, every tribe on earth gets blessed, say less.
[1 Nephi 22:10] Yo, bros, just so you know, no squad on earth gets blessed unless God flexes His power straight up in front of all the nations, no cap.
[1 Nephi 22:11] So, God's gonna flex hard in front of every nation, pushing His promises and gospel to the house of Israel like it's main-character energy.
[1 Nephi 22:12] God's gonna pull them out of captivity, squad them up back to their own lands, drag them outta the shadows and darkness, and they'll finally peep that the Lord's their Savior and Redeemer...the real MVP of Israel.
[1 Nephi 22:13] The blood of that massive sus church...the whore of all the earth...will literally bounce back on them; they'll beef with each other, and their own swords will end up slicing their own heads, straight-up wasted in their own mess.
[1 Nephi 22:14] Any nation beefing with you, house of Israel, will end up clapping back at their own crew and fall into the trap they set for God's people; everyone fighting Zion? Totally wiped out. That huge sus church twisting God's ways? It's gonna crash hard and hit the dirt big time.
[1 Nephi 22:15] Listen up, the prophet says the clock's ticking fast till Satan loses all clout over people's hearts; soon the proud and wicked will be like dry grass...ready to get totally burned down.
[1 Nephi 22:16] The time's almost here when God's full-on wrath drops hard on everyone; He's not gonna let the wicked run roughshod over the righteous, no cap.
[1 Nephi 22:17] So God's gonna shield the righteous with His power, even if His wrath goes full pyro and wipes out the bad guys; no need to sweat it...the prophet says the righteous will get saved, even if it's through the fire.
[1 Nephi 22:18] Yo, fam, these things are about to drop...blood, fire, and smoke vibes all over the earth; this hits people straight in the flesh if they keep flexing hard hearts against the Holy One of Israel.
[1 Nephi 22:19] Straight up, the righteous ain't gonna die; the time's for real coming when anyone throwing hands at Zion gets totally cut off.
[1 Nephi 22:20] God's definitely setting up a path for His people, fulfilling Moses' prophecy that He'll raise a prophet just like him...y'all better listen to everything he says or risk getting cut off from the squad.
[1 Nephi 22:21] So yeah, I'm Nephi telling you straight...this prophet Moses hyped? That's the Holy One of Israel himself, and He's gonna drop judgment with full-on righteous vibes.
[1 Nephi 22:22] The righteous? Chill, no need to fear...they won't get embarrassed. But watch out for the devil's squad building up among humans, totally grounded in the flesh crew.
[1 Nephi 22:23] Real talk, soon enough every church built just for cash, flexing on flesh, chasing clout, or feeding worldly cravings and all kinds of sin...they're the devil's crew who gotta freak out, shake, and get humbled hard, burned down like stubble, just like the prophet said.
[1 Nephi 22:24] Time's almost here when the righteous will be led up like calves in the stall, and the Holy One of Israel will flex with full dominion, power, and mad glory.
[1 Nephi 22:25] He's pulling His kids from all corners of the earth, keeping count of His squad who totally recognize Him; there'll be one crew, one main shepherd feeding them, and they'll find their vibes in Him.
[1 Nephi 22:26] Because His people are rocking that righteousness, Satan's straight-up powerless and locked up for mad years; he can't touch their hearts since they vibe in righteousness and the Holy One of Israel runs the show.
[1 Nephi 22:27] Yo, it's Nephi here telling you all this stuff is gonna go down for real, straight up in the flesh.
[1 Nephi 22:28] Bet, all nations, tribes, languages, and peeps can vibe safe under the Holy One of Israel...if they just say sorry and switch up.
[1 Nephi 22:29] Alright, I'm out...Nephi here...'cause I ain't bold enough to spill more on this just yet.
[1 Nephi 22:30] Yo fam, peep this: what's on the brass plates is legit real, straight-up proof that a dude's gotta obey God's commandments, no cap.
[1 Nephi 22:31] So don't think it's just me and pops dropping receipts and lessons...if you stay obedient and hold strong till the end, you're safe come judgment day. Facts. Amen.
[2 Nephi 1:1] So after I, Nephi, finished schooling my bros, our dad Lehi stepped up and dropped mad stories about how the Lord came through big time, pulling us out of Jerusalem like a boss.
[2 Nephi 1:2] He called them out for acting sus on the boat but flexed on God's mercy for not letting the sea drag them under...straight up saved their lives.
[2 Nephi 1:3] He also hyped up the promised land we scored and how God was low-key clutch, dropping warnings to bounce from Jerusalem before things got messy.
[2 Nephi 1:4] Yo, he said he had a vision straight-up confirming Jerusalem gets wrecked, and if we stayed, we would've been toast too...no cap.
[2 Nephi 1:5] But he said, even with all the stress, we scored a prime promised land...way better than the rest; God promised it to me and my fam forever, plus anyone the Lord pulls outta other countries by His hand.
[2 Nephi 1:6] So, I'm Lehi, and I'm vibing with the Spirit saying no one's landing in this spot unless the Lord personally pulls up and brings them here.
[2 Nephi 1:7] So this land's reserved for whoever God brings, and if they serve Him by the rules, it's straight-up a land of freedom...no chains for real; but if they go sus with sin, the land gets cursed for them, while the righteous get that eternal W.
[2 Nephi 1:8] Real talk, it's smart to keep this land on the DL from other nations, 'cause if everyone found out, they'd swarm it and leave no room for the fam's inheritance.
[2 Nephi 1:9] So, I, Lehi, got the promise: anyone God pulls from Jerusalem who sticks to His commandments will thrive here, stay shielded from other nations, own this land for real, get mad blessings, no haters messing with their turf, and chill safe forever.
[2 Nephi 1:10] But listen, when they start ghosting belief after stacking mad blessings...knowing the earth's creation, God's epic moves since day one, flexing faith power, having all commands from the jump, and landing in this prime promised land...if they end up throwing shade at the Holy One of Israel, the real Messiah and their God, justice's gonna clap back hard on them.
[2 Nephi 1:11] For real, He's gonna send other nations against them, flex His power by snatching their lands, and scatter them everywhere, getting smacked down hard.
[2 Nephi 1:12] Yo, as generations switch up, bloodshed and major drama will hit; so, my sons, I'm telling you, keep this locked in and actually listen to my words.
[2 Nephi 1:13] Man, I wish y'all would wake up from that deep-ass sleep...like Hell-level sleep...and break free from those savage chains trapping humanity, dragging them down to eternal misery and straight-up woe.
[2 Nephi 1:14] Wake up and get up from the dirt, hear your shaky parent dropping truth...they're about to hit the cold, silent grave with no comebacks; just a few days left, then I'm off like everyone else.
[2 Nephi 1:15] But check it, the Lord snatched my soul outta hell; I've peeped His glory and now I'm wrapped up forever in His love, no cap.
[2 Nephi 1:16] I low-key want y'all to keep His rules and judgments front and center; frfr, this has stressed me out since day one.
[2 Nephi 1:17] My heart's been heavy with mad sorrow sometimes, fearing y'all's stubbornness might trigger God's full-on wrath and get you wiped out forever.
[2 Nephi 1:18] Or that a curse sticks with y'all for generations, getting hit by sword, famine, mad hate, and dragged around like puppets by the devil's playbook.
[2 Nephi 1:19] Yo sons, I'm praying y'all dodge this mess and flex as God's chosen squad, but fr, His will's final...His ways are righteous always.
[2 Nephi 1:20] God's said straight up: stick to His commandments and you'll thrive here; ignore them and you're getting ghosted from His presence, no cap.
[2 Nephi 1:21] For real, I want my soul to flex joy in y'all and bounce from this world with mad gladness, not dragged down by pain; so get up from the dust, sons, grow up, lock in one mindset and heart, squad up tight, and avoid getting taken captive.
[2 Nephi 1:22] So y'all don't catch a nasty curse or catch the heat from a just God that leads to straight-up eternal destruction of soul and body, no cap.
[2 Nephi 1:23] Wake up, sons; flex that armor of righteousness, snap those chains holding you down, step outta the shadows, and rise up from the dust.
[2 Nephi 1:24] Stop beefing with your brother who's been solid, kept commandments since we bounced from Jerusalem, and low-key saved us from starving in the wilderness; yet y'all tried to cancel him and he's been lowkey hurt 'cause of you.
[2 Nephi 1:25] I'm shook and low-key scared y'all gonna make him suffer again; y'all said he's after power and clout, but nah, he's just chasing God's glory and your eternal good, no cap.
[2 Nephi 1:26] Y'all been whining 'cause he kept it real and called out your flaws; you say he was harsh or angry, but nah, that sharpness was straight-up God's word flexing through him, and that 'anger' was just truth dropping hard on your sins...he couldn't hold back.
[2 Nephi 1:27] God's power had to be with him, even when he told y'all to obey, but real talk...it wasn't him, it was the Lord's Spirit inside him making him speak up, no cap, he couldn't zip it.
[2 Nephi 1:28] Yo Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Ishmael's crew, if y'all actually listen to Nephi's vibe, you won't get wrecked; and if you do, I'm handing you my OG blessing, no cap.
[2 Nephi 1:29] But if you ghost his words, I'm retracting my OG blessing and dropping it all on him instead, bet.
[2 Nephi 1:30] Yo Zoram, I see you...you were Laban's servant, but now you're outta Jerusalem and low-key ride or die for my son Nephi, no cap, forever squad goals.
[2 Nephi 1:31] Since you stayed loyal, your fam and Nephi's fam will vibe in blessings, living good on this land long-term; nothing but sin can mess with their prosperity, and even that's a rare sus moment.
[2 Nephi 1:32] So, if y'all stick to God's commandments, He's locked down this land as a safe spot for your crew and my son's squad, no cap.
[2 Nephi 2:1] Yo Jacob, listen up: you're my OG firstborn from my tough wilderness days, and even as a kid, you caught mad grief and sorrow 'cause your bros were straight-up rude to you.
[2 Nephi 2:2] Still, Jacob, my wilderness firstborn, you know God's flex is real, and He's gonna turn your struggles into straight-up glow-up energy for you.
[2 Nephi 2:3] So, your soul's gonna get mad blessed, you'll vibe safe with your bro Nephi, and you'll spend your days serving God; no cap, you're redeemed 'cause of your Redeemer's righteousness... you've seen that He's rolling through at the perfect time to drop salvation on humanity.
[2 Nephi 2:4] You caught His glory back in your youth, so you're blessed just like those He'll serve in the flesh; the Spirit's steady...yesterday, today, forever...and the path's set since the fall, with salvation handed out for free.
[2 Nephi 2:5] People get the 411 to tell good from evil, and the law's dropped on them; but real talk, the law alone can't justify anyone...it clips them, no cap. For real, by the earthly law they get cut off, and by the spiritual law they lose out on the good stuff and get stuck miserable forever.
[2 Nephi 2:6] So listen, redemption hits through the Holy Messiah...He's the real deal, packed with grace and truth, no cap.
[2 Nephi 2:7] Peep this: He drops Himself as the sacrifice for sin to check all the boxes of the law...for anyone with a busted heart and humble spirit; no one else can flex that legal win.
[2 Nephi 2:8] So yeah, it's mad important to spread this vibe: no human can kick it with God straight-up without the merits, mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who straight-up laid down His life in the flesh and then flexed the Spirit's power to come back first in the resurrection game.
[2 Nephi 2:9] So He's God's firstfruits, cause He's throwing in the good word for all people; and anyone who believes in Him is straight-up saved, no cap.
[2 Nephi 2:10] Because He's interceding for everyone, all people roll up to God's presence to get judged based on His truth and holiness; so the law's ends, given by the Holy One, drop punishment that opposes the happiness tied to atonement's purpose.
[2 Nephi 2:11] Yo, there HAS to be opposites in everything, fam...no cap. Otherwise, bro, no righteousness, wickedness, holiness, misery, good, or bad could exist. Everything gotta be mixed up; if it was just one, it'd be dead af...no life, death, decay, joy, pain, or even feelings. Straight-up ghost mode.
[2 Nephi 2:12] So if that were true, it would've been straight-up pointless from the jump; no endgame in creation at all. That would totally cancel out God's wisdom, eternal plans, power, mercy, and justice...big L for the whole vibe.
[2 Nephi 2:13] If you say no law exists, then no sin either. And no sin means no righteousness. No righteousness, no happiness. No happiness or righteousness, no punishment or misery. If none of that's real, then no God. And no God means no us, no earth...no creation, no action, nothing. Everything would've just ghosted for real.
[2 Nephi 2:14] Alright fam, I'm dropping this knowledge for your gain...God's real, and He made everything: the heavens, the earth, and all that's in 'em, both the players and the played.
[2 Nephi 2:15] So God's eternal plan for humans kicks in after He made our OG parents, the wild animals, birds, and basically everything else; and low-key there had to be opposition ... like the forbidden fruit vs. the tree of life; one sweet, the other straight-up bitter vibes.
[2 Nephi 2:16] So, God gave humans the power to make moves for themselves, but that only works if they get tempted by one side or the other...no free acting otherwise.
[2 Nephi 2:17] So, I, Lehi, peeped the texts and gotta think an angel dipped from heaven, went rogue, and turned devil by chasing evil before God...major sus energy.
[2 Nephi 2:18] Since this dude fell from heaven and got stuck in misery forever, he's out here trying to drag all of humanity down too. So, that old serpent...the devil, king of lies...told Eve, "Eat the forbidden fruit, you won't die, you'll be like God, knowing good and evil." Total cap.
[2 Nephi 2:19] After Adam and Eve snatched that forbidden fruit, they got bounced from Eden and had to grind farming the earth.
[2 Nephi 2:20] They went on to have kids...like, literally the whole fam of the entire earth.
[2 Nephi 2:21] God extended human lifespans so peeps could actually repent while alive; life became like a test, stretched out by His commands. He made it clear: everyone's gotta repent because we're lost thanks to our parents' mess-up.
[2 Nephi 2:22] So, if Adam hadn't messed up, he'd still be chillin' in Eden, and everything made would've stayed stuck in that original state forever, with zero change or end.
[2 Nephi 2:23] They wouldn't have had kids, so they'd stay innocent but low-key joyless since they never faced misery; no good vibes either, 'cause sin was off the radar.
[2 Nephi 2:24] But check it, everything went down with the OG wisdom of the one who's got all the receipts and knows everything.
[2 Nephi 2:25] Adam fell so humans could exist; and humans exist so they can catch some real joy...say less.
[2 Nephi 2:26] The Messiah shows up right on time to redeem humans from the fall, so they get eternal freedom, knowing good from evil, free to choose their moves...unless they catch the ultimate clapback from God on Judgment Day, per His commands.
[2 Nephi 2:27] So, humans get freedom in the flesh with everything they need, and can flex by choosing liberty and eternal life through the ultimate Mediator, or get trapped in devil's clutches and death, 'cause he's out here trying to make everyone as miserable as he is.
[2 Nephi 2:28] Yo sons, focus up on the great Mediator, vibe with His big commandments, stay loyal to His words, and pick eternal life powered by His Holy Spirit's drip.
[2 Nephi 2:29] Don't fall for eternal death by caving to fleshly cravings and evil that let the devil flex his power to trap you and boss you around in his own kingdom.
[2 Nephi 2:30] I dropped these words to you all, my sons, in my final stretch; I picked the good side like the prophet said, straight up caring only about your souls' eternal glow-up. Amen.
[2 Nephi 3:1] Yo Joseph, my youngest, I'm speaking to you now; you were born in the wildest mess of my struggles, straight up during my deepest pain when your mom had you.
[2 Nephi 3:2] May the Lord bless this land for you...a precious spot...as your inheritance and your fam's, plus your crew's, securing you forever, if y'all stay loyal to the Holy One of Israel's commandments.
[2 Nephi 3:3] Joseph, my youngest, whom I pulled through my toughest trials, may the Lord bless you always...your line won't be wiped out, no cap.
[2 Nephi 3:4] Yo, you're straight from my bloodline, a descendant of Joseph who got snagged in Egypt, and the Lord's covenants with Joseph? Big moves, no cap.
[2 Nephi 3:5] So Joseph low-key peeped our era and snagged a promise from God that from his fam God would raise a righteous branch for Israel...not the Messiah, but a branch cut off yet still remembered in God's covenants, 'cause the Messiah's reveal would flex in the last days, powering the squad from dark vibes to light, from lowkey captivity to full-on freedom.
[2 Nephi 3:6] Joseph straight-up testified that the Lord would hype up a choose-your-own-adventure seer from his fam's line to lead the way.
[2 Nephi 3:7] For real, Joseph said God told him He'd raise a top-tier seer from your fam who'll be mad respected, tasked with a major mission to help your bros unlock the receipts on the covenants made with your ancestors.
[2 Nephi 3:8] God said He'll lock him in on just one hustle...the job He assigns...and make him big in His eyes 'cause he'll be grinding only for Him.
[2 Nephi 3:9] He's gonna be a whole vibe like Moses, who I promised to send to free my people, House of Israel...say less.
[2 Nephi 3:10] I'm legit gonna raise up Moses to flex and free your people from Egypt's clutches.
[2 Nephi 3:11] I'll raise a seer from your fam who'll have the power to drop my word to your descendants...not just spill the tea, but also convince them of it when the message's already out there, says the Lord.
[2 Nephi 3:12] So your fam's descendants and Judah's crew will both be dropping writes, and their combined work will shut down fake teachings, end beef, build peace among your people, and school them on their ancestors and my covenants in the last days, says the Lord.
[2 Nephi 3:13] When my work kicks off among all my people, he'll glow up from weak to strong to bring back the House of Israel...straight from the Lord's playbook.
[2 Nephi 3:14] Joseph prophesied straight up: the Lord's gonna bless that seer, and anyone trying to cancel him will get rekt, 'cause this promise I scored from God about my fam's line is 100% locked in.
[2 Nephi 3:15] His name's gonna flex mine and his dad's, and he'll be like me, 'cause through him, with God's power, the Lord's plan will pull my people into salvation...no cap.
[2 Nephi 3:16] Joseph kept it 100, confident like he's sure about Moses' promise...God told him straight up He'd keep his fam's line forever, no cap.
[2 Nephi 3:17] The Lord said He'll raise up a Moses, give him power in a rod, and drop judgment in writing. He won't let him talk a ton or be a smooth talker, but God'll write His law on him personally and hook him up with a hype-man to speak for him.
[2 Nephi 3:18] The Lord told me He'll raise up someone from your fam and hook him with a spokesperson. He'll give him the job to write down your fam's story for your fam, while the spokesperson flexes it out loud.
[2 Nephi 3:19] The words he drops will be exactly what my wisdom says your fam needs to hear...like your descendants are shouting from the grave, 'cause I know their faith is real.
[2 Nephi 3:20] Even after mad generations pass, they'll be crying out from the dust for their bros to repent, and their shout'll hit just right 'cause their words keep it simple.
[2 Nephi 3:21] 'Cause of their faith, their words will come straight from my mouth to their fam, and I'll level up their shaky words with strong faith so they remember the covenant I made with your ancestors.
[2 Nephi 3:22] Yo, my son Joseph, this is exactly how my OG dad dropped his prophecy back in the day.
[2 Nephi 3:23] So, because of this covenant, you're blessed...your fam won't get wiped out 'cause they'll vibe with the words in the book, no cap.
[2 Nephi 3:24] Look, someone major's gonna rise up among them, flexing mad good vibes in speech and action, God's own tool with insane faith, pulling off epic miracles to restore the house of Israel and your fam's descendants big time.
[2 Nephi 3:25] Alright Joseph, you're blessed but still young...so listen up to your bro Nephi's words and watch it unfold exactly like I said. Don't forget your pops' final words. Amen.
[2 Nephi 4:1] So yeah, I'm Nephi, here to spill on the prophecies my dad dropped about Joseph, the dude who got carted off to Egypt.
[2 Nephi 4:2] No cap, he legit prophesied about all his fam, dropping some of the biggest prophecies ever. He spoke on us and the fam to come, and it's all locked down on the brass plates.
[2 Nephi 4:3] So after my dad finished dropping the Joseph prophecies, he called up Laman's kids...sons and daughters...and was like, "Yo, my firstborn's crew, y'all better listen up to what I'm saying."
[2 Nephi 4:4] God's word is straight: keep the commandments and you'll thrive in the land, but slack off and you're getting ghosted from His presence, no cap.
[2 Nephi 4:5] Yo, my kids, I can't just dip without dropping a blessing on you, because I know if you grow up right, you won't stray from the path, no cap.
[2 Nephi 4:6] So if you end up cursed, I'm still leaving my blessing to flip that curse back onto your parents' heads...say less.
[2 Nephi 4:7] Thanks to my blessing, God won't let you fade out; He'll show mad mercy to you and your fam forever, no cap.
[2 Nephi 4:8] After my dad finished with Laman's squad, he called up Lemuel's kids to come through next.
[2 Nephi 4:9] He told Lemuel's kids, "Yo, fam of my second son, I'm dropping the same blessing I gave Laman's crew...y'all won't get wiped out, and your descendants will end up blessed big time."
[2 Nephi 4:10] So after finishing with them, my dad hit up Ishmael's sons and straight-up everyone in his household.
[2 Nephi 4:11] When he finished with them, he told Sam, "You and your crew are blessed...you're gonna inherit land just like your bro Nephi, your fam gonna roll with his, and blessings will be your steady vibe forever."
[2 Nephi 4:12] After my dad Lehi poured his heart out to the whole fam, riding that Holy Spirit wave, he aged out, then died and got buried...end of story.
[2 Nephi 4:13] Not long after my dad died, Laman, Lemuel, and Ishmael's boys got mad at me 'cause of God's warnings...major sus energy.
[2 Nephi 4:14] I, Nephi, had no choice but to call them out like God said, dropping stuff my dad and I already said before he dipped...most of that tea's on my other plates, low-key a whole history archive.
[2 Nephi 4:15] On these plates, I'm jotting down what's deep in my soul, plus scriptures from the brass plates, 'cause my soul's vibing with them and my heart's always thinking...writing so my kids can level up and glow up too.
[2 Nephi 4:16] Low-key, my soul's all about God's stuff, and my heart's constantly marinating on all the things I've seen and heard...no cap.
[2 Nephi 4:17] Even with God flexing mad goodness and miracles, my heart's like, "Bruh, I'm a mess!" Feeling down 'cause of my flesh and soul dragging over my own sins...big oof.
[2 Nephi 4:18] I'm surrounded, fr, by temptations and sins that hit me hard and low-key trap me all the time.
[2 Nephi 4:19] When I wanna vibe and be happy, my heart throws shade 'cause of my sins, but no cap, I know who I got my trust in.
[2 Nephi 4:20] My God's my rock, guiding me through tough times in the wilderness and keeping me afloat on the wild deep waters...no cap.
[2 Nephi 4:21] He's packed me full of His love so deep it's like it's burning through my very flesh...intense, no cap.
[2 Nephi 4:22] He's straight-up wrecked my haters so hard they're shaking in their boots when they face me.
[2 Nephi 4:23] Bet, He hears my daytime cries and drops wisdom in my dreams at night...say less.
[2 Nephi 4:24] During the day, I've been flexing bold prayers, sending my voice straight to the top, and angels rolled through to hook me up.
[2 Nephi 4:25] His Spirit legit lifted me up to crazy high peaks, and my eyes saw stuff way too wild for humans, so I was told to keep it on the DL and not write it down.
[2 Nephi 4:26] Yo, if I've seen crazy great stuff and the Lord's been mad merciful to us humans, why am I out here crying and stuck in misery, letting my body and strength fade 'cause of my struggles?
[2 Nephi 4:27] So why would I let my flesh make me cave to sin? Why let temptations give the evil one a spot in my heart to wreck my peace and mess with my soul? And why be salty over my haters?
[2 Nephi 4:28] Wake up, my soul! Stop slacking in sin. Get hyped, my heart, and don't let the enemy of my soul crash your vibe anymore.
[2 Nephi 4:29] Don't let my haters rile me up again, and don't let my struggles drain my energy...stay strong, no cap.
[2 Nephi 4:30] Get hyped, my heart, shout out to the Lord, and say: O Lord, I'm giving you mad props forever; my soul's vibin' with you, God, the solid rock saving me.
[2 Nephi 4:31] Yo Lord, you gonna save my soul? Get me outta my enemies' grip? Can you make me so woke I shake just seeing sin roll up?
[2 Nephi 4:32] Let hell's gates stay locked on me 24/7 'cause my heart's crushed and spirit's humble! Yo Lord, don't close the gates of your goodness on me...lemme keep it real in the low valleys, stickin' tight to the straight-up plain path.
[2 Nephi 4:33] Yo Lord, wrap me up in your righteous drip! Hook me a clear escape route from my enemies, make my path straight AF, and don't throw me any curveballs...clear my way and block the haters' moves instead.
[2 Nephi 4:34] Lord, I've put my trust in you and I'm riding with that forever. No cap, I won't trust in human strength 'cause anyone who does is straight cursed...real talk, trusting flesh or man is sus and doomed.
[2 Nephi 4:35] Bet, I know God's all about giving big to those who ask right. So I'll keep yelling out to you, my God, the solid rock of my good vibes. My voice gonna rise up to you forever, my rock and eternal God. Amen.
[2 Nephi 5:1] So check it, I, Nephi, was yelling at the Lord non-stop 'cause my bros were mad salty at me.
[2 Nephi 5:2] But real talk, their rage just kept leveling up, trying straight-up to end me.
[2 Nephi 5:3] They were straight-up whining, like: "Our little bro's tryna boss us around, and he's been causing mad drama; let's just off him so his talk don't mess with us more. Nah, he ain't the boss...being the older sibs, ruling's our flex."
[2 Nephi 5:4] I ain't even gonna spill all the tea they threw at me here, just know they were dead set on snatching my life.
[2 Nephi 5:5] Then God hit me up with a warning: I, Nephi, had to bounce from them and dip into the wilderness, with anyone down to roll with me.
[2 Nephi 5:6] So I, Nephi, scooped up my fam, Zoram's crew, my older bro Sam and his peeps, younger bros Jacob and Joseph, plus my sisters and anyone down to ride. Everyone who rolled with me vibed with God's warnings and revelations, so they tuned into my message.
[2 Nephi 5:7] We packed up our tents and whatever else we could grab, then trekked through the wilderness for mad days. After all that, we finally set up camp.
[2 Nephi 5:8] My squad wanted to name the spot Nephi, so that's exactly what we called it.
[2 Nephi 5:9] Everyone who rolled with me decided to flex the name "people of Nephi" as their crew identity.
[2 Nephi 5:10] We low-key made sure to follow God's rules, laws, and commands in everything, sticking to Moses' script all day.
[2 Nephi 5:11] God was riding with us, so we straight-up thrived; we planted seeds and got mad harvests back, plus started leveling up with flocks, herds, and all kinds of animals.
[2 Nephi 5:12] I, Nephi, also hauled the records etched on the brass plates, plus the ball...like a compass...God had hooked up for my dad, straight from the scriptures.
[2 Nephi 5:13] We started blowing up big time, stacking blessings and growing our squad all over the land.
[2 Nephi 5:14] I, Nephi, grabbed Laban's sword and flexed by crafting hella swords like it, just in case the Lamanites tried to slide and clap us ... I knew they low-key hated me, my kids, and my crew.
[2 Nephi 5:15] I schooled my people on flexing construction, grinding woodwork, and bossing up iron, copper, brass, steel, gold, silver, and all the drip precious ores stacked crazy.
[2 Nephi 5:16] I, Nephi, built a temple modeled on Solomon's vibe, just less bling 'cause the land was low on flex materials. Still, the build was top-tier, mad finesse all around.
[2 Nephi 5:17] So I, Nephi, got my people grinding hard, making moves and putting in that manual hustle.
[2 Nephi 5:18] They wanted me as king, but I, Nephi, was low-key not feeling the royal drip; still, I did what I could for them within my power.
[2 Nephi 5:19] Look, God's words came through about my bros...saying I'd be their boss and teacher...so I held that role following His commands, till they got shady and tried to end me.
[2 Nephi 5:20] So God's prophecy went down: since they ghosted my words, they got fully cut off from the Lord's vibe ... and yeah, that's exactly what happened.
[2 Nephi 5:21] God dropped a heavy curse on them 'cause they straight-up hardened their hearts like flint; since they started off white and mad fair, He gave them a black skin so they wouldn't low-key vibe with my people.
[2 Nephi 5:22] God said straight up: they'll be sus and unwelcome to your crew unless they bounce back and quit their shady ways.
[2 Nephi 5:23] Anyone who mixes their bloodlines with theirs gets hit with the same curse, no cap. The Lord said it, and boom...it was locked in.
[2 Nephi 5:24] So, thanks to their curse, they turned into lazy troublemakers, always scheming and hunting wild predators in the wilderness.
[2 Nephi 5:25] God told me they'd be a pain to your fam, shaking them to remember Him; but if they ghost His words, those same haters will drag them down to ruin.
[2 Nephi 5:26] So I, Nephi, officially set up Jacob and Joseph as priests and teachers to run spiritual school over my people's land.
[2 Nephi 5:27] And so, we vibed living that straight-up happy lifestyle, no cap.
[2 Nephi 5:28] Thirty years had slid by since we dipped out of Jerusalem.
[2 Nephi 5:29] I, Nephi, kept receipts on my plates, tracking my people's story up to that point.
[2 Nephi 5:30] Then God told me to flex some new plates and etch a bunch of stuff He's feeling, all for my people's glow-up.
[2 Nephi 5:31] So, me, Nephi, staying woke and obedient, made those plates and engraved all this real talk like the Lord said.
[2 Nephi 5:32] I carved what vibes with God, and if my crew's down with God's stuff, they'll be hype about my engravings on these plates too.
[2 Nephi 5:33] If my people wanna dive deep into the deets of our story, they gotta scroll through my other plates, no cap.
[2 Nephi 5:34] Forty years had rolled by, and low-key, we'd already thrown down in wars and beefs with our own fam.
[2 Nephi 6:1] Jacob, Nephi's brother, dropped these words straight to the Nephi crew:
[2 Nephi 6:2] Yo, fam, it's Jacob here...God's callin', ordained in His holy squad, blessed by my bro Nephi, your king and shield, your rock for safety. You know I've already dropped mad knowledge on y'all.
[2 Nephi 6:3] But fr, I'm back at it 'cause I'm hella worried about y'all's souls. You know my anxiety's been real since day one. I've been grinding to teach y'all, dropping my dad's wisdom and spilling all the tea from the world's OG creation.
[2 Nephi 6:4] So now, listen up...I'm about to drop knowledge on what's poppin' now and what's coming next; I'm reading Isaiah's words, since my bro wants me to. I'm doing this for y'all, so you can learn and flex with God's name.
[2 Nephi 6:5] The words I'm about to read are Isaiah's for all Israel's fam...so yeah, they low-key apply to you since you're reppin' the house of Israel. Isaiah's drops got mad parallels with your story, no cap.
[2 Nephi 6:6] God says: Watch this, I'm raising my hand to the Gentiles, waving my flag high; they'll be carrying your sons in their arms and your daughters on their shoulders, no cap.
[2 Nephi 6:7] Kings will low-key be your nursing dads, queens your nursing moms; they'll bow so hard they kiss the ground at your feet. You'll know it's the Lord's move 'cause those who wait on Him won't catch no shame.
[2 Nephi 6:8] So yeah, Jacob here...God showed me that the folks back in Jerusalem, where we dipped from, got wrecked and hauled off as captives, no joke.
[2 Nephi 6:9] But check it, God showed me they'll make a comeback. Plus, the Holy One of Israel's gonna show up IRL, but then they'll roast and crucify Him...straight up like the angel told me, no cap.
[2 Nephi 6:10] After they flex mad stubbornness and block the Holy One of Israel, watch...their payback's coming hard. The day's gonna drop when they get hit with all the smackdowns and struggles.
[2 Nephi 6:11] So yeah, after getting tossed around like random glitches, tons will catch the L in their bodies but won't totally ghost thanks to the faithful's prayers. They'll be scattered, dragged, and low-key hated...but God's mercy vibes strong, and when they wake up to their Redeemer, they'll squad up again in their OG lands.
[2 Nephi 6:12] Gentiles, you're blessed...prophet wrote you in the script. If you do a full 180, don't beef with Zion, and dodge that sus, toxic church, you're getting saved for real. God's gonna keep His promises to His fam, that's why these words got penned.
[2 Nephi 6:13] So, anyone throwing hands at Zion and God's crew will end up eating dust at their feet. But God's people? They flex no shame, 'cause they're patient, still hyped for the Messiah's comeback.
[2 Nephi 6:14] Peep this: prophet says the Messiah's gonna roll up again for round two to save them; He'll show up with mad power and flex, smashing their haters when they finally vibe with Him...no believer gets wrecked, period.
[2 Nephi 6:15] But those who don't vibe with Him? They're catching the full Wreck-It-Ralph: fire, storms, quakes, bloodshed, plagues, and famines. After all that, they'll finally get that the Lord is God, the Holy One of Israel.
[2 Nephi 6:16] Like, does the strong dude lose his catch? Or does the legit captive get set free? Nah, fam.
[2 Nephi 6:17] But God says: even the mighty's captives get snatched back, the terrible's prey gets rescued...'cause the Mighty God's got His covenant crew's back. He's gonna throw down with anyone beefing with you.
[2 Nephi 6:18] I'll make those who mess with you eat their own mistakes, getting wasted on their own downfall like it's vintage wine. Then everyone will know I, the Lord, am your Savior and the Mighty One of Jacob.
[2 Nephi 7:1] God's like, "Did I ghost you for good? Where's the breakup notice from your mom? Who did I sell you to? Nah, you sold yourselves out with your own mess-ups, and that's why your mom got ditched."
[2 Nephi 7:2] So when I showed up, no one was there; I called but got ghosted. Yo, Israel, do you think my power's weak or that I can't save you? Nah, I can dry up oceans, turn rivers to dust, and even make fish rot 'cause I cut the water...my rebuke's that serious.
[2 Nephi 7:3] I drape the skies in blackout mode and deck them out in sackcloth like it's mourning season.
[2 Nephi 7:4] God gave me the rizz of the wise so I can drop the right word at the right time to you, Israel. When you're tired, He wakes me up daily, tuning my ear to listen like a pro.
[2 Nephi 7:5] God popped my ear open, and I wasn't out here acting sus or dipping back...no cap, I stayed woke and loyal.
[2 Nephi 7:6] I let the hitters clap my back and took the scalp grabs without flinching. Didn't even flex or hide when they threw shade and spit on me.
[2 Nephi 7:7] God's got my back, so no way I'm catching L's. I set my jaw like stone, knowing I won't ever feel that shame vibe.
[2 Nephi 7:8] God's right here, backing me up hardcore. Who's trying to beef? Let's link up. Got beef? Roll up, I'll wreck you with my words alone.
[2 Nephi 7:9] God's got me on lock. Anyone throwing shade or trying to cancel me? Bet...they'll fade away like old clothes, getting eaten up by moths, no cap.
[2 Nephi 7:10] Yo, who's out here scared of the Lord, vibing with His servant's words, yet walking in the dark with zero light?
[2 Nephi 7:11] Y'all who start fires and hype yourselves up with sparks, keep riding that light you made...bet you'll end up crashing hard, laid out in pure sorrow, no cap.
[2 Nephi 8:1] Listen up, all you chasing righteousness. Remember the solid rock you came from and the deep pit they dug you out of...don't forget your origin story.
[2 Nephi 8:2] Peep Abraham, your OG dad, and Sarah, your mama, 'cause I picked him solo and hooked him up with mad blessings.
[2 Nephi 8:3] God's about to vibe with Zion, healing all her empty spots; turning her wastelands into Eden-level gardens, full of mad joy, hype, gratefulness, and straight-up bops.
[2 Nephi 8:4] Yo, listen up, my squad and my whole nation; I'm dropping laws and laying down judgment that'll be the ultimate glow-up light for everyone.
[2 Nephi 8:5] My righteous vibes are close; salvation's already flexing out, and my power's ready to judge. Even the isles are on standby, trusting my strength, no cap.
[2 Nephi 8:6] Look up to the skies and down at the earth; the heavens will ghost like smoke and the earth get old like worn-out clothes, and everyone there will fade too. But my salvation? That's eternal flex, and my righteousness is here to stay, no cap.
[2 Nephi 8:7] Yo, all you righteous peeps with my law inked in your hearts, don't sweat the haters' shade or their loudmouth trash talk...stay unbothered.
[2 Nephi 8:8] Moths gonna munch on them like old clothes, worms gonna chow like wool, but my righteousness? That's eternal drip, and my salvation's passing down gen to gen, no cap.
[2 Nephi 8:9] Rise up, rise up! Flex your power, Lord's arm...wake up like back in the OG days. Weren't you the one who sliced Rahab and smacked down the dragon?
[2 Nephi 8:10] Ain't you the same one who dried up the sea, turned the deep waters into a path so the rescued could walk through? Say less.
[2 Nephi 8:11] So, the Lord's rescued squad will bounce back to Zion singing loud; eternal joy and holiness will crown their heads, snagging pure happiness while all the sad vibes dip for good.
[2 Nephi 8:12] It's me, for real...I'm the one who's got your back. So why you out here scared of people who're just gonna die, like grass that fades away? Get a grip.
[2 Nephi 8:13] You low-key forgot the Lord who made you, who stretched out the skies and built the earth's base, but you keep stressing daily over that oppressor like he's about to wreck you? So where's that big bad fury now?
[2 Nephi 8:14] The captive exile's rushing to break free, no cap...no way they're gonna die stuck in the pit or run outta bread.
[2 Nephi 8:15] But yo, I'm the Lord your God, the one who made the waves roar; Lord of Hosts is the name I flex.
[2 Nephi 8:16] I put my words in your mouth and shield you under my hand's shadow, 'cause I'm the one who built the skies and set the earth's foundations, telling Zion straight up: You're my crew.
[2 Nephi 8:17] Wake up, wake up, stand tall, Jerusalem...you've sipped deep from the Lord's cup of rage and chugged the last shaky drops squeezed out.
[2 Nephi 8:18] But no one's there to guide her, not one among all her own kids she raised, no hand to hold hers. Low-key tragic.
[2 Nephi 8:19] These two sons roll up to you...your desolation and wreckage, famine and sword...and honestly, who's gonna bring you the comfort you need?
[2 Nephi 8:20] Your sons all tapped out except these two; they're chilling at every street corner like a wild bull caught in a net, totally loaded with the Lord's rage and God's serious clapback.
[2 Nephi 8:21] So listen up, you stressed and out of it, but not 'cause of booze...get your ears ready.
[2 Nephi 8:22] Yo, says your Lord, your God's got your back, took that shaky cup of fury right out your hand...no more sipping that poison, ever again.
[2 Nephi 8:23] But I'm handing that cup to your haters, the ones who told your soul, "Bow down, so we can walk all over you"...and you let them treat your body like the sidewalk.
[2 Nephi 8:24] Rise up, Zion, flex your power; rock your finest fit, Jerusalem, the holy city...'cause from now on, no sus unclean or uncircumcised vibes gonna slide in here.
[2 Nephi 8:25] Dust off, get up and chill, Jerusalem; break free from those chains around your neck, captive daughter of Zion...time to bounce.
[2 Nephi 9:1] Yo, my beloved fam, I dropped these facts so y'all can peep the Lord's covenants He made with the whole house of Israel...say less.
[2 Nephi 9:2] He's been chatting with the Jews through His holy prophets since day one, generation to generation, till the squad gets back to God's real church and fam; they'll be gathered home to their inherited lands, set up solid in all their promised spots.
[2 Nephi 9:3] Listen up, my beloved crew, I'm spilling this so y'all can vibe high and flex forever, 'cause the Lord's about to drop mad blessings on your kids...big W energy.
[2 Nephi 9:4] I know y'all have been digging deep, trying to flex on what's next; so you already get that our bodies gotta fade and die, but no cap...our flesh gonna see God face-to-face.
[2 Nephi 9:5] Yeah, I know you know He'll show up in the flesh to the Jerusalem crew, where we're from; it's gotta go down that way...our Creator humbling Himself, taking on flesh and dying for everyone, so everyone can be His followers, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:6] Since death hit every human as part of the Creator's mercy plan, resurrection's gotta be a thing; it's a must 'cause of the fall, which happened 'cause of transgression, and 'cause we fell, we got cut off from the Lord's presence...facts.
[2 Nephi 9:7] So, there's gotta be an infinite atonement...without that, corruption can't turn incorruptible. Otherwise, the OG judgment on man would've lasted forever, and this flesh would just chill in the dirt, no resurrection, no glow-up.
[2 Nephi 9:8] Bruh, God's wisdom, mercy, and grace are next level! 'Cause if the flesh didn't rise, our spirits would be stuck under that fallen angel who dipped from God's presence and turned devil...no comeback for them.
[2 Nephi 9:9] Our spirits would've ended up like him, becoming devils...angels for a devil...locked out from God's presence, stuck with the father of lies, miserable like him; yeah, the same dude who tricked our OG parents, who fake flexes as an angel of light and hyped up humans into low-key murder plots and all kinds of shady dark deeds.
[2 Nephi 9:10] Yo, God's goodness is mad big...He sets up the ultimate escape route from this terrifying monster; yeah, that beast death and hell, which I'm calling the death of the body and the spirit, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:11] Thanks to God's epic rescue plan, the Holy One of Israel, this death I'm talking about...the temporary kind...will spit out its dead; yeah, death is basically the grave, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:12] That spiritual death I mentioned, aka hell, will have to hand over its dead too; so death and hell gotta deliver their captives, hell frees the spirits, the grave frees the bodies, and bodies and spirits get reunited...all powered by the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:13] God's plan is straight-up legendary! Paradise gotta hand back the righteous spirits, the grave gotta give up their bodies, and spirits and bodies link back up; then everyone goes incorruptible, immortal, vibing as living souls with knowledge like ours in the flesh...but for real, our knowledge will be next-level perfect.
[2 Nephi 9:14] So, we'll get full-on receipts of our guilt, dirtiness, and bare flaws; meanwhile, the righteous flex perfect knowledge of their blessings and clean vibes, rocking the ultimate purity drip...the robe of righteousness, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:15] When everyone levels up from this first death to life, getting that immortal flex, they gotta show up before the judgment-seat of the Holy One of Israel; then judgment drops, and they get judged straight up by God's holy standards, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:16] Deadass, as the Lord lives...He dropped this eternal word that never expires...righteous stay righteous, filthy stay filthy; so the filthy are the devil and his crew, heading straight to eternal fire made for them, where the torment's like an endless lake of fire and brimstone, flames forever, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:17] Yo, God's justice and greatness are mad real! He delivers on every word that drops from His mouth, and His law is straight-up unbreakable, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:18] But check it, the righteous saints who stan the Holy One of Israel, who endured the world's drama and shook off the shame, they're gonna inherit God's kingdom...set up for them since day one...and their joy? It's gonna be full-on eternal, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:19] Yo, God's mercy is next-level, the Holy One of Israel! He pulls His saints out from that terrifying monster...the devil, death, hell, and that never-ending lake of fire and brimstone torment, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:20] God's holiness is straight fire...He's got full-on omniscience, knows every single thing, no cap, nothing slips by Him.
[2 Nephi 9:21] He rolled up into the world to save everyone...if they're down to listen to His voice; fr, He took on the pains of all people, every single living soul from the fam of Adam, men, women, and kids included.
[2 Nephi 9:22] He took that L so resurrection could hit everyone, making sure all can flex standing before Him on the big judgment day, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:23] He's straight-up ordering everyone to repent and get baptized in His name, with 100% faith in the Holy One of Israel...no faith, no pass to God's kingdom, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:24] If they ghost on repentance, faith, baptism in His name, and endurance till the end, they're straight-up doomed; Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, already said it, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:25] So, He dropped a law; no law means no punishment, no punishment means no condemnation, and no condemnation means the Holy One of Israel's mercy vibes hit them hard thanks to the atonement...they get saved by His power, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:26] The atonement handles justice for everyone without the law, saving them from that terrifying squad...death, hell, devil, and the endless lake of fire torment...and bringing them back to the God who breathed life into them, the Holy One of Israel, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:27] But fr, big L to anyone who's got God's commandments handed down like us and still breaks them, wasting their probation time...trust, their situation is mad sus and serious.
[2 Nephi 9:28] Yo, that evil one's scheme is low-key slick, but humans? They're mad foolish, thinking smarts = wisdom; they ignore God's advice thinking they got all the rizz solo, but nah, their "wisdom" is straight-up dumb and does them zero favors...they're bound to crash and burn.
[2 Nephi 9:29] Being smart is a W, but only if they actually vibe with God's advice and listen up.
[2 Nephi 9:30] Big L to the rich who flex worldly stuff; cuz they're loaded, they side-eye the poor and throw shade at the humble, their hearts glued to their stacks, treating cash like their god...newsflash, their treasure's gonna crash and burn with them too.
[2 Nephi 9:31] Heads up to the deaf who choose not to listen...they're on a fast track to demise, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:32] Straight-up disaster for the blind who refuse to peep the truth...they're set to fall too, no lie.
[2 Nephi 9:33] Big trouble for those with hearts uncircumcised...when judgment comes, the receipts on their sins will hit them hard, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:34] Major L for the liar...they're gonna get dragged down to hell, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:35] Watch out for the cold-blooded murderer who kills on purpose...they're straight up doomed to die.
[2 Nephi 9:36] Big L for anyone out here committing whoredoms...they're finna get sent straight to hell, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:37] Low-key disaster for idol worshippers; even the devil's devil is hyped on their vibes.
[2 Nephi 9:38] At the end of the day, big L to anyone who dies stuck in their sins; they'll roll up to God's face but stay trapped in their mess.
[2 Nephi 9:39] Yo fam, don't forget how savage it is to mess with the Holy God or get played by that slick devil; living for the flesh is straight-up death, but vibing with the Spirit is eternal life, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:40] Yo fam, listen up and remember how epic the Holy One of Israel is; don't cap that I'm throwing shade, cuz I'm just dropping your Maker's real talk...truth hits hard on all the sketchy stuff, but the righteous? They're unbothered, riding high on that realness.
[2 Nephi 9:41] Yo, fam, pull up to the Lord, the Holy One...his path is straight fire; the way for humans is narrow but dead-on, guarded by the Holy One of Israel, no helpers, no side doors...no cap, it's gate or nothing 'cause God don't get played.
[2 Nephi 9:42] Whoever knocks, God opens up, but heads full of flexin'...the smarty-pants, rich folks puffed up on their swag...God lowkey despises; unless they drop the ego, call themselves straight-up fools before Him, and get humble AF, that door stays shut.
[2 Nephi 9:43] But all the wisdom and good vibes? Yeah, they'll stay on ghost mode for those fools forever...the happiness set aside for the saints ain't for them, no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:44] Yo fam, peep this...I'm dropping all my layers and shaking them out for y'all; I'm praying that God, who saves me, scopes me with His all-seeing eye...so on Judgment Day, you'll know God saw me shake off your mess from my soul, standing clean and shining, no receipts of your blood on me.
[2 Nephi 9:45] Yo fam, bounce from your sins, shake off those chains from the one tryna lock you down, and roll up to the God who's the solid rock saving you.
[2 Nephi 9:46] Get your souls ready for that big day when justice drops on the righteous...the Judgment Day...so you don't freak out with mad fear or get hit with full-on guilt remembering your sins and gotta say, "Holy, holy are your judgments, Lord," while knowing you messed up and the devil's got you trapped in his awful misery.
[2 Nephi 9:47] But yo, fam, do I need to wake y'all up to how savage these truths are? Would I even shake your souls if your minds were clean? Would I keep it 100 if you were sin-free? Say less.
[2 Nephi 9:48] Look, if y'all were holy, I'd be hyping holiness, but since you're not and peep me as your teacher, I gotta keep it real and school you on what sin brings...no cap.
[2 Nephi 9:49] Yo, my soul straight-up hates sin, my heart's vibin' with righteousness, and I'm hyping up the holy name of my God nonstop.
[2 Nephi 9:50] Yo fam, if you're thirsty, come sip these waters; broke? No worries...come grab wine and milk for free, no cap, no price tags.
[2 Nephi 9:51] Don't blow cash or grind for stuff that's dead weight and won't fill you up. Listen close, remember what I said, come to the Holy One of Israel, and feast on the real deal that never rots...let your soul glow up with that main-character energy.
[2 Nephi 9:52] Yo fam, keep God's words on your mind; hit Him up all day with prayers and thank His holy name come night. Let your hearts vibe with pure joy.
[2 Nephi 9:53] Yo, peep how massive the Lord's covenants are and how He's low-key humbled Himself for us; 'cause of His mad greatness, grace, and mercy, He promised our descendants won't get wiped out for real...they'll be kept safe and in future gens, they'll flex as a righteous branch in Israel's fam.
[2 Nephi 9:54] Aight fam, I got more to spill, but I'll drop the rest of my words tomorrow. Amen, say less.
[2 Nephi 10:1] Yo, it's Jacob back at it, talking to my beloved fam again about that righteous branch I was telling y'all about.
[2 Nephi 10:2] So peep this, the promises we got are real for us flesh and blood; even though I saw plenty of our kids gonna bounce from unbelief, God's still got mad mercy for many, and our kids will be brought back to catch that true knowledge of their Redeemer, no cap.
[2 Nephi 10:3] So yeah, like I said, it's gotta go down that Christ...angel told me that's His name last night...will roll up to the Jews, who low-key are the worst crew around; they'll straight-up crucify Him 'cause that's the move God set, and no other squad on earth would ever do that to their God.
[2 Nephi 10:4] If those epic miracles went down with other nations, they'd low-key repent and realize He's their God, no cap.
[2 Nephi 10:5] But 'cause of priestcraft and mad sinning, the folks in Jerusalem gonna be stubborn AF and end up crucifying Him, no lie.
[2 Nephi 10:6] So yeah, 'cause of their sins, they're gonna catch destruction, famine, plagues, and straight-up bloodshed; the ones who survive gonna get scattered all over the place.
[2 Nephi 10:7] But check it, the Lord God says: when the day drops that they finally believe I'm Christ, I promised their ancestors they'll be brought back in the flesh, back to their OG lands...say less.
[2 Nephi 10:8] Watch this, they'll be gathered up from their long exile...from sea isles and all four corners of the earth...and the Gentile nations gonna look big in God's eyes for helping bring them back to their homeland, no cap.
[2 Nephi 10:9] For real, the Gentile kings will be like dads nursing their kids, and their queens like moms; God's promises to the Gentiles are huge...He said it, so who's gonna argue?
[2 Nephi 10:10] But peep this, God says this land is your inheritance, and the Gentiles are gonna catch mad blessings on it.
[2 Nephi 10:11] This land's gonna be a liberty zone for the Gentiles, with no kings popping up over them to boss them around.
[2 Nephi 10:12] I'm gonna lock down this land, no cap, keeping all other nations out.
[2 Nephi 10:13] Anyone who throws hands at Zion? Deadass, God says they're gonna get wrecked.
[2 Nephi 10:14] Whoever tries to crown a king against me? They're donezo; I, the Lord, king of heaven, will be their forever king and the light for those who vibe with my words.
[2 Nephi 10:15] So yeah, to keep my promises to mankind while they're still breathing, I gotta smash all the shady underground evil...murders and nasty abominations...no cap.
[2 Nephi 10:16] So anyone throwing hands at Zion...Jew or Gentile, slave or free, guy or girl...gonna get wiped out; they're basically the earth's biggest L, 'cause if you ain't with me, you're against me, says God.
[2 Nephi 10:17] Bet, I'm rolling out my promises to humanity and I'll deliver while they're still alive in the flesh...no cap.
[2 Nephi 10:18] Yo fam, God's word is real: your descendants will get hit hard by the Gentiles, but I'll soften those Gentile hearts so they flex like fathers to them; so the Gentiles get blessed and join the house of Israel's squad.
[2 Nephi 10:19] So I'm setting this land aside forever for your fam and anyone repping your line...it's prime real estate, God told me. Anyone living there has gotta worship me, no exceptions, says God.
[2 Nephi 10:20] Yo fam, since our merciful God dropped mad knowledge on us, let's remember Him, ditch our sins, and keep our heads up...we're not canceled, even if we got bounced from our inheritance; God made the sea our highway, and now we're vibing on an island in the middle of it.
[2 Nephi 10:21] The Lord's promises are huge for those chilling on the isles of the sea; since it says "isles" plural, there's gotta be more, and our bros are living there too.
[2 Nephi 10:22] Look, the Lord God's been snatching folks from Israel's house here and there as He vibes; now He's got receipts on everyone chopped off, so yeah, He's remembering us too.
[2 Nephi 10:23] So hype up your hearts and remember: you're free to make your own moves...pick the vibe of eternal death or go big with everlasting life.
[2 Nephi 10:24] So fam, make peace with God's will, not the devil's or your own wild urges; and don't forget, after you squad up with God, it's only His grace that saves you...no cap.
[2 Nephi 10:25] So may God flex His resurrection power to pull you from death, and use the atonement to save you from eternal wipeout, so you can join His eternal kingdom and hype Him forever by His dope grace. Amen.
[2 Nephi 11:1] So Jacob dropped mad knowledge to the squad back then, but I'm only putting these verses down 'cause what I wrote is already enough for me.
[2 Nephi 11:2] Yo, I'm Nephi, and I'm vibing hard with Isaiah's words...my soul's all in. I'm gonna break down his words for my crew and send them to all my fam 'cause he legit saw my Redeemer, just like I did.
[2 Nephi 11:3] My bro Jacob saw Him just like I did, so I'm dropping their words to my kids to prove mine ain't cap. With three witnesses, God said He's locking down His word, but He's got more receipts and backs up every single one.
[2 Nephi 11:4] Low-key, my soul gets hyped proving to my people that Christ's coming is for real; the law of Moses dropped for this exact reason, and everything God's given since day one points straight to Him.
[2 Nephi 11:5] I'm totally vibing with the Lord's covenants to our ancestors; my soul's all about His grace, justice, power, and mercy in the epic eternal plan to rescue us from death.
[2 Nephi 11:6] My soul's hyped on showing my people straight up: if Christ doesn't come through, everyone's toast, no cap.
[2 Nephi 11:7] No Christ, no God; no God, no us...'cause nothing would've even been made. But facts: there's a God, He's Christ, and He shows up right on time.
[2 Nephi 11:8] I'm dropping Isaiah's words so anyone in my crew who peeps this can hype up and vibe with joy for all people. These words are real, so flex them on yourself and everyone else.
[2 Nephi 12:1] Isaiah, Amoz's son, got the 411 straight on Judah and Jerusalem...here's what he saw.
[2 Nephi 12:2] In the last days, the Lord's house will be flexed on top of all mountains, outshining the hills, and every nation will be streaming there no cap.
[2 Nephi 12:3] Tons of people will be like, "Squad, let's roll up to the Lord's mountain, the house of Jacob's God; He'll school us on His ways, and we'll vibe with His path...'cause Zion's sending out the law and the Lord's word from Jerusalem."
[2 Nephi 12:4] He's gonna judge the nations and call out mad people; swords get trashed into plows, spears turned into pruning hooks...no more flexing war vibes, and nobody's gonna learn that mess again.
[2 Nephi 12:5] Yo, house of Jacob, let's bounce and walk in the Lord's light; fr, you've all been sus, each one caught up in their own shady moves.
[2 Nephi 12:6] So, Lord dipped on Your people, the house of Jacob, 'cause they filled up with eastern vibes, got caught up with soothsayers like the Philistines, and low-key vibed with strangers' kids.
[2 Nephi 12:7] Their land's loaded with silver and gold, flexing endless treasures; horses and chariots stacked up with no chill, no cap.
[2 Nephi 12:8] Their land's packed with idols...they're basically worshipping stuff they made themselves, straight up hand-crafted fake flex.
[2 Nephi 12:9] The petty dude won't bow, and the big shot won't humble up...so, no cap, don't cut them any slack.
[2 Nephi 12:10] Yo wicked squad, crawl into the rock and ghost into the dust, 'cause the Lord's fear and epic glow gonna smack you hard.
[2 Nephi 12:11] When the day drops, all the high-key flexing and ego trips get low-key humbled, and only the Lord's main-character energy gets the crown.
[2 Nephi 12:12] The Lord of Hosts' day is rolling up on every nation...proud flexers, high-key egos...everyone puffed up is about to get put on mute and brought down low.
[2 Nephi 12:13] Bet, the Lord's day is about to hit all those tall cedars of Lebanon 'cause they're flexin' way too hard, plus all the oaks of Bashan too.
[2 Nephi 12:14] It's coming for all the high mountains, hills, every nation acting all extra, and literally every squad out there.
[2 Nephi 12:15] The Lord's day don't play...it's coming for every tall tower and all those flexed-up walls.
[2 Nephi 12:16] It's finna hit all the sea ships, every Tarshish vessel, and even all those boujee art vibes.
[2 Nephi 12:17] All human flex gets clapped down, egos get crushed, and only the Lord gets that top-tier glow-up that day.
[2 Nephi 12:18] He's gonna straight-up cancel all those fake idols, no cap.
[2 Nephi 12:19] They'll be ghosting into rock holes and caves 'cause the Lord's fear and flexed-up glory gonna smack them hard when He shocks the earth big time.
[2 Nephi 12:20] On that day, folks will yeet their silver and gold idols they made to flex at, straight into caves where moles and bats vibe.
[2 Nephi 12:21] They'll dip into rock crevices and jagged peaks 'cause the Lord's badass fear and majestic glow-up gonna hit hard when He shakes the earth like whoa.
[2 Nephi 12:22] Stop putting your W on humans...they're just breathing sacks...like seriously, what's the big deal about them?

[2 Nephi 13:4] Bet...I'ma hand them kids as their leaders, straight-up babies running the show.
[2 Nephi 13:5] Everyone's gonna be clapping back at each other, neighbors beefin', kids throwing shade at elders, and the lowkey trash acting tough against the VIPs.
[2 Nephi 13:6] Someone grabs their bro from the fam and goes, "You got drip, run the squad, don't let this mess get worse."
[2 Nephi 13:7] Then dude's gonna swear off being a fixer, like, "Nah, I ain't about that life...my crib's broke, no bread, no drip...don't crown me king."
[2 Nephi 13:8] Jerusalem's busted, Judah's down 'cause their talk and moves were all sus against the Lord, straight disrespecting His glow-up.
[2 Nephi 13:9] Their faces throw receipts exposing their sin...Sodom-level sus...and they can't even hide it. Big yikes for their souls, they low-key scored evil for themselves.

[2 Nephi 13:11] Big L for the wicked...they're gonna fade out, getting served exactly what their own hands cooked up.
[2 Nephi 13:12] Yo, my people, kids bossing y'all around and women running the scene; the so-called leaders got you twisted and wrecking your path, fr.
[2 Nephi 13:13] The Lord's stepping up to the mic, ready to judge and clap back at the crowd, no cap.

[2 Nephi 13:15] What's the tea? You're straight-up smashing my people and grinding the poor's faces, says the Lord God of Hosts.
[2 Nephi 13:16] Also, the Lord's like: 'Those daughters of Zion got mad attitude, strutting with their necks out, eyes throwing shade, prancing around making noise like they own the place.'
[2 Nephi 13:17] So, the Lord's gonna hit the daughters of Zion with a nasty scalp roast and expose their dirty secrets, no cap.
[2 Nephi 13:18] On that day, the Lord's gonna snatch away their flashy bling, head wraps, and those moon-shaped hoops, no flex.

[2 Nephi 13:20] Bye-bye to their hats, leg bling, headbands, charms, and earrings...Lord's taking all that.

[2 Nephi 13:23] Glasses, fancy linen, hoods, and veils? Yeah, Lord's totally snatching those fits away.
[2 Nephi 13:24] So, instead of smelling fresh, it'll be straight-up stanky; where there was a belt, there'll be a tear; good hair? Nah, bald spots. Fancy tops? Just sackcloth wraps ... burning looks, not beauty.

[2 Nephi 15:3] Yo, folks of Jerusalem and Judah, listen up...help me settle this beef between me and my vineyard, no cap.
[2 Nephi 15:4] Like, what else could I have done for my vineyard that I didn't already do? I expected grapes, but it went and dropped wild grapes instead...lowkey sus.
[2 Nephi 15:5] Bet, here's the move: I'm taking down the hedge so it gets eaten up, and I'll smash the wall so it gets trampled...no cap.
[2 Nephi 15:6] I'm gonna ghost that vineyard...no pruning, no digging...just briers and thorns popping up everywhere, and I'm blocking the clouds, so no rain for that mess.
[2 Nephi 15:7] The Lord's vineyard? That's Israel and Judah, His prized plants; He expected justice but caught straight-up oppression, asked for righteousness but only heard cries...big oof.
[2 Nephi 15:8] Yo, savage warning to those stacking house on house till there's zero space left...thinkin' they'll chill solo in the middle of the earth? Big L coming, no cap.
[2 Nephi 15:9] Heard it straight from the Lord of Hosts' mouth...tons of houses gonna be ghost towns, and big fancy cities? Empty vibes, no residents, dead silence.
[2 Nephi 15:10] For real, ten acres of vineyard will barely drop one bath, and a homer of seed will only whip up an ephah...low-key weak harvest, no cap.
[2 Nephi 15:11] Mad shade on those who wake up hella early just to chase drinks all day, riding that wine wave till nightfall...y'all getting straight fired up for the wrong reasons.
[2 Nephi 15:12] At their parties, it's all harp, violin, drums, pipes, and wine...but they're totally ghosting God's work, not even peeping what His hands have done.
[2 Nephi 15:13] So yeah, my people got dragged into captivity 'cause they got no clue; their so-called leaders starving and the masses straight-up parched, no cap.
[2 Nephi 15:14] No cap, hell's wide open, mouth agape with no chill; their flex, their crowd, their hype, and every hypebeast gonna slide right into that abyss.
[2 Nephi 15:15] The petty will get knocked down, the big shots humbled, and even the high-key proud gonna have their eyes leveled...say less.
[2 Nephi 15:16] But for real, the Lord of Hosts is gonna flex in judgment, and the holy God will be mad respected in pure righteousness...no cap.
[2 Nephi 15:17] Then the little lambs will vibe and graze their way, while strangers gobble up the leftover spots of the rich and spoiled...big facts.
[2 Nephi 15:18] Mad L to those dragging sin along like it's some stylish rope, flexin' vanity like it's their ride or die...major sus energy.
[2 Nephi 15:19] They be like, "Yo, hurry up and drop that move, let us witness it; lemme get the Holy One of Israel's plan ASAP, so we can flex on the tea."
[2 Nephi 15:20] Big L for those flipping the script, calling evil good and good evil, swapping dark for light, and switching bitter and sweet like it's no big deal.
[2 Nephi 15:21] Major L for the peeps thinking they're all that and wise just 'cause they flex their own brainpower...talk about being mad sus.
[2 Nephi 15:22] Bet on this: big L to the strong dudes knocking back wine and flexing with hard drinks like it's their vibe.
[2 Nephi 15:23] Shoutout to no one: those who clear the bad guys for a bag and snatch the creds from the decent...mad sus moves, fr fr.
[2 Nephi 15:24] So like fire burns stubble and flames smoke chaff, their roots gonna rot and their bloom turn to dust...'cause they ghosted the Lord's law and dissed the Holy One's word, no cap.
[2 Nephi 15:25] So God's rage hits hard against His people, reaching out and smacking them down; hills shook and bodies got wrecked in the streets, but His anger's still on blast, hand stretched out wide, no chill.
[2 Nephi 15:26] God's gonna hype a flag for the nations way out, sending a loud whistle from the world's edge; peeps will roll through fast, no cap...no one's gonna lag or trip up.
[2 Nephi 15:27] No one's catching Z's or slacking off; their gear stays tight, laces untouched...ready to move at any moment, no cap.
[2 Nephi 15:28] Their arrows stay sharp, bows fully flexed, horses hoofin' like flint, wheels spinning like a cyclone, and their roar hits like a lion's main-character energy.
[2 Nephi 15:29] They're gonna roar like fresh lions, snatch their prey quick, haul it off safe, and no one's coming through to save the day...straight up unstoppable.
[2 Nephi 15:30] On that day, they'll roar like the wild sea, and when people check the land, it's all gloom and vibes gone dark, like the sky's lost its glow...straight up bleak energy.
[2 Nephi 16:1] The year King Uzziah dipped, I peeped the Lord flexin' on a throne way up high, His drip filling the whole temple...serious main character energy.
[2 Nephi 16:2] Above Him were the seraphim, rocking six wings each...two hiding their faces, two covering their feet, and two for straight-up flying flex.
[2 Nephi 16:3] One seraph shouted to the squad, "Holy, holy, holy's the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth's dripping with His glory, no cap."
[2 Nephi 16:4] The doorposts shook on the seraph's shout, and the whole place got smoked up...big vibes, no lie.
[2 Nephi 16:5] I was like, "Big yikes on me, I'm toast...unclean lips and all...and stuck in a squad just as sus 'cause I just peeped the King, the Lord of Hosts."
[2 Nephi 16:6] Then one seraph zoomed over with a lit coal in hand, snatched fresh from the altar with tongs...ready to glow up my soul.
[2 Nephi 16:7] He pressed that coal to my mouth, said, "Yo, this just hit your lips...your mess is wiped, and your sins are cleaned out, say less."
[2 Nephi 16:8] Then I caught God's voice like, "Who's down to go on this mission?" I was like, "Bet, I'm here...send me."
[2 Nephi 16:9] He said, "Go tell these people...yeah, they hear for sure, but no cap, they don't get it; they see clearly, yet low-key they don't vibe with it."
[2 Nephi 16:10] Turn their hearts to maxed-out thick, ears hella heavy, and eyes shut tight...so they don't actually see, hear, or get it in their hearts, avoiding the glow-up and healing vibe.
[2 Nephi 16:11] I asked, "Lord, how long tho?" He said, "Till cities ghosted with no one left, houses empty, and the land straight-up desolate, deadass."
[2 Nephi 16:12] God's gonna yeet people far away 'cause the land's gonna hit peak ghost town mode, no cap.
[2 Nephi 16:13] Still, a tenth squad will bounce back; they'll get munched like a teal tree or oak shedding leaves, but the holy seed's the real MVP keeping things alive low-key.
[2 Nephi 17:1] During Ahaz's reign, son of Jotham and Uzziah, Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, rolled up on Jerusalem for war, but their flex got shut down...no cap.
[2 Nephi 17:2] News hit the house of David that Syria teamed up with Ephraim, and their hearts shook like trees getting caught in a wild windstorm, straight-up no chill.
[2 Nephi 17:3] God told Isaiah, "Roll out with your kid Shearjashub to meet Ahaz by the upper pool's conduit on the fuller's field highway, say less."
[2 Nephi 17:4] Tell him, "Chill and don't freak out over those two firebrand clowns...Rezin with Syria and Remaliah's kid...they're all rage but low-key not worth the stress."
[2 Nephi 17:5] 'Cause Syria, Ephraim, and Remaliah's son schemed some sus plans against you, saying:
[2 Nephi 17:6] "Let's roll up on Judah, wreck the vibe, break through the defenses, and plug in a king they vibe with...Tabeal's son, no cap."
[2 Nephi 17:7] God's flex: That whole plan? Nah, it won't hold up or even happen, trust.
[2 Nephi 17:8] Syria's main man is Damascus, and Damascus bows to Rezin; in 65 years, Ephraim's gonna get snapped so hard they ain't even a squad anymore.
[2 Nephi 17:9] Ephraim's boss is Samaria, and Samaria's king is Remaliah's son. If you don't trust this, you're straight-up not gonna stand firm...facts.
[2 Nephi 17:10] Also, God hit up Ahaz again with some fresh words, say less.
[2 Nephi 17:11] God said, "Flex a sign from me...whether deep down or way up high, your call."
[2 Nephi 17:12] But Ahaz was like, "Nah, I'm not asking or testing God's patience, trust."
[2 Nephi 17:13] God said, "Yo, house of David, you already drain people, now you wanna stress me out too? Deadass?"
[2 Nephi 17:14] So God's dropping a sign Himself...look, a virgin's gonna have a kid and name him Immanuel, no cap.
[2 Nephi 17:15] He'll be munchin' on butter and honey, learning how to dodge the evil and flex on the good choices.
[2 Nephi 17:16] Before this kid even gets how to choose good over bad, that land you're low-key hating on will ghost both its kings, straight up abandoned.
[2 Nephi 17:17] God's about to hit you, your crew, and your fam with days worse than anything since Ephraim split from Judah and the Assyrian king rolled up.
[2 Nephi 17:18] On that day, God'll snap his fingers to call the fly chillin' in Egypt's far corner and the bee buzzing in Assyria's zone.
[2 Nephi 17:19] They'll roll up and crash everywhere...empty valleys, rocky hideouts, thorny spots, and all the bushes, no cap.
[2 Nephi 17:20] That same day, God'll flex with a hired razor from beyond the river...Assyria's king...clean-shaving the head, feet hair, and even the beard, straight wiped out.
[2 Nephi 17:21] That day's gonna hit when a dude's lowkey raising a young cow and a couple of sheep, vibin' with the animals.
[2 Nephi 17:22] They'll be so loaded with milk, he's gonna feast on butter; real talk, everyone left in the land will be munchin' butter and honey, no cap.
[2 Nephi 17:23] On that day, spots that had mad vines worth a grand will be straight-up overrun with briars and thorns...total L energy.
[2 Nephi 17:24] People will show up packing arrows and bows 'cause the whole land's turned into a wild tangle of briars and thorns...mad sus out there.
[2 Nephi 17:25] But yo, any hills dug up with a mattock won't catch the sketchy vibe of briars and thorns; instead, they'll be the plug spot for oxen and small cattle to vibe and roam.
[2 Nephi 18:1] So God told me straight up: grab a huge scroll and use some real handwriting to jot down stuff about Maher-shalal-hash-baz...say less.
[2 Nephi 18:2] I pulled up with solid witnesses to lock it in: Uriah the priest and Zechariah, Jeberechiah's son, real ones for the receipts.
[2 Nephi 18:3] I hit up the prophetess, she got pregnant and popped a son; then God told me straight...name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz, no cap.
[2 Nephi 18:4] No lie, this kid won't even say "Dad" or "Mom" before Damascus's cash and Samaria's swag get snatched by Assyria's king...fast and furious.
[2 Nephi 18:5] God hit me up once more, dropping more words to peep.
[2 Nephi 18:6] Since these folks are out here ignoring the chill flow of Shiloah's waters and vibing hard with Rezin and Remaliah's kid, big sus energy.
[2 Nephi 18:7] So yeah, God's flexing with a flood...Assyria's king rolling through like a tidal wave, smashing every channel and bank, no chill.
[2 Nephi 18:8] He's about to roll through Judah, flooding deep up to the neck, wings spreading wide, taking over all your turf, Immanuel...big flex incoming.
[2 Nephi 18:9] Squad up if you want, y'all gon' get wrecked for real; anyone tuning in from afar, strap in...but fr, you'll still catch these L's, no cap.
[2 Nephi 18:10] Plan all you want, it's gonna flop; spill your words, they won't hold up...God's got us on lock, no stress.
[2 Nephi 18:11] God hit me hard with a firm word, telling me to dodge the crowd's vibes and not follow their path, straight up.
[2 Nephi 18:12] Don't catch the word "confederacy" just 'cause they say it; don't catch their fear or let it low-key scare you, say less.
[2 Nephi 18:13] Put God, the Lord of Hosts, on your main stage...make Him your only fear and biggest respect, no cap.
[2 Nephi 18:14] He's gonna be your safe spot, but also a trip-up stone for Israel's squads, like a trap for Jerusalem's peeps...mad paradox energy.
[2 Nephi 18:15] Lots of them are gonna trip, wipe out, get caught in the trap, and straight-up captured...no cap.
[2 Nephi 18:16] Lock down the testimonies and seal the law tight with my crew, no leaks allowed.
[2 Nephi 18:17] I'm just gonna chill and wait on the Lord, even if He's ghosting Jacob's crew, still got my eyes peeled for Him.
[2 Nephi 18:18] Low-key, me and the kids God handed me are straight-up signs and wonders flexing in Israel, all reps for the Lord of Hosts chilling on Mount Zion.
[2 Nephi 18:19] When they hit you up like, "Go ask the spirit talkers and wizards who whisper secrets," shouldn't you be sliding to your actual God to hear from the beyond, no cap?
[2 Nephi 18:20] Stick to the law and the testimony; if they ain't vibing with these words, it's 'cause they running dark, no light in their feed.
[2 Nephi 18:21] They're gonna struggle big time, starving and stressed out; when hunger hits, they'll throw shade at their king and God, then look up hoping for a save.
[2 Nephi 18:22] They'll stare at the ground and just see chaos, dark vibes, mad pain, and get pushed deeper into the shadows, no cap.
[2 Nephi 19:1] Still, the gloom won't be as savage as when he first flexed on Zebulun and Naphtali, then went harder through the Red Sea past Jordan in Galilee of the nations.
[2 Nephi 19:2] The folks who were lost in darkness just caught mad glow; those vibing in death's shadow are getting lit up by the light.
[2 Nephi 19:3] You blew up the nation and boosted the hype...people flex joy like harvest season and squad celebrating the clutch loot split.
[2 Nephi 19:4] You snapped the yoke off their necks, crushed the weight on their shoulders, and smashed the oppressor's rod...no more cap on their grind.
[2 Nephi 19:5] Every warrior's fight sounds like chaos and drips blood-stained threads, but this one's gonna come through with fire and straight-up fuel, no chill.
[2 Nephi 19:6] No cap, a kid's born to us, a son's gifted; he's taking the whole government on his shoulder, and his tag? Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace...peak main character energy.
[2 Nephi 19:7] The glow-up of government and peace never stops on David's throne...he's running the show, locking it down with mad justice forever; the Lord of Hosts is hyped to make it happen, no cap.
[2 Nephi 19:8] The Lord dropped His word on Jacob, and it lit up Israel...straight fire, no cap.
[2 Nephi 19:9] Everyone gonna catch the vibe...Ephraim and Samaria residents too...who're flexing mad pride and chest-thumping confidence.
[2 Nephi 19:10] The bricks might've dipped, but we're switching up with solid hewn stones; sycamores got chopped, but we're leveling them up into sturdy cedars...flex upgrade, no cap.
[2 Nephi 19:11] Bet, the Lord's gonna squad up Rezin's haters and squad their enemies tight against him...no chill, just facts.
[2 Nephi 19:12] Syrians frontin', Philistines on his back, ready to gobble Israel raw; but no cap, God's still heated and keeping His hand outstretched, no chill.
[2 Nephi 19:13] People keep ignoring the one who's whooping them and don't even bother sliding into the Lord of Hosts' DMs.
[2 Nephi 19:14] So, God's about to sever Israel's head and tail, branch and reed...all in one day...straight execution mode.

[2 Nephi 19:20] He's grabbing food with the right hand but still hungry; munching with the left but never full...they'll end up biting their own arms just to vibe, no cap.
[2 Nephi 19:21] Manasseh and Ephraim got each other's backs, teaming up against Judah; but guess what? God's still heated, hand stretched out, no chill.
[2 Nephi 20:1] Big yikes to those pushing shady laws and dropping heavy-handed rules like it's a flex.
[2 Nephi 20:2] They low-key block the needy from getting justice, snatch rights from the poor, and treat widows like prey while robbing orphans...straight savage energy.
[2 Nephi 20:3] So, when the day of reckoning drops and destruction rolls in from miles away, who you gonna call? Where's your flex gonna hide then?
[2 Nephi 20:4] Without me, they'll be bowing to captors and dropping like deadbeats; but God's still heated, hand stretched out, no cap.
[2 Nephi 20:5] Yo Assyrian, you're the rod of my rage, the staff they flex with to show their beef.

[2 Nephi 20:13] Dude's all like, "It's my own muscle and brainpower that pulled these moves; I'm smart, shifted borders, snatched treasures, and crushed folks like a boss."
[2 Nephi 20:14] My hand swooped the people's riches like finding a nest, scooping up leftover eggs; I grabbed the whole world's loot, and no one even flapped or made a peep, dead silent.

[2 Nephi 23:13] Bet, I'm gonna shake the heavens and make the earth bounce from its spot, all 'cause the Lord of Hosts is flexing mad fury on His rage day.
[2 Nephi 23:14] They'll scatter like a deer on the run and sheep left behind; everyone's gonna dip back to their own crew and bounce to their own turf, fast.
[2 Nephi 23:15] Anyone flexing pride gets poked through, and anyone rolling with the wicked gets taken down by the sword, no cap.
[2 Nephi 23:16] Their kids get wrecked right in front of them; their homes get trashed, and their wives get taken...straight savage consequences.
[2 Nephi 23:17] Watch, I'm gonna hype up the Medes to roll on them, and these Medes don't care 'bout silver or gold...they ain't flexing for the bling.
[2 Nephi 23:18] Their bows will wreck young men hard; no chill for babies either...they ain't sparing a single kid, ruthless energy.
[2 Nephi 23:19] Babylon, the big boss of kingdoms and the flex of Chaldees, gonna get dunked on just like when God clapped back on Sodom and Gomorrah.
[2 Nephi 23:20] That spot will stay ghosted forever...no one setting up camp or vibing there generation after generation; not even Arabian tent-pitchers or shepherds tryna build their crib.
[2 Nephi 23:21] Instead, desert beasts will chill there; the cribs will be packed with creepy vibes, owls will squat, and satyrs will be turning up all night.
[2 Nephi 23:22] Island wild beasts gonna howl in those empty spots, dragons raging in what used to be lit palaces; her time's almost up, no cap...I'm dropping her fast to save my squad, while the wicked get wiped out.
[2 Nephi 24:1] The Lord's got mad mercy for Jacob, still picking Israel to chill in their own hood; even outsiders will link up and stick tight with Jacob's crew.
[2 Nephi 24:2] People will squad up and bring them back, like from way across the globe to their promised spots; Israel's fam will own the land, and the Lord's turf will be for servants; they'll even snatch back the captors and boss over their haters.
[2 Nephi 24:3] When that day drops, the Lord's gonna bless you with chill vibes, freeing you from all the stress, fear, and tough grind you were stuck in.
[2 Nephi 24:4] When that day hits, you'll clap back at the Babylon king, saying: The oppressor's donezo, the golden city's straight-up canceled!
[2 Nephi 24:5] The Lord snapped the wicked's staff and crushed the rulers' scepters...game over for their power.
[2 Nephi 24:6] The dude who kept beating people down with nonstop rage and ruled nations madly is now getting hunted, and nobody's stepping in to save him.
[2 Nephi 24:7] The whole world's finally vibing calm and quiet, then suddenly everyone bursts out singing like it's a main event.
[2 Nephi 24:8] Even the fir trees and Lebanon cedars are hyped, saying: Since you checked out, no one's been chopping us down...straight up peace.
[2 Nephi 24:9] Hell's shook, coming up to face you; it wakes the dead squad...the earth's top bosses...and yanks all the kings off their thrones, no lie.
[2 Nephi 24:10] They all gonna talk, asking, "Yo, you feeling as weak as us now? You really turned into one of us?"
[2 Nephi 24:11] Your flex is buried in the grave, the sound of your viols gone silent; worms are hanging out underneath and all over you...major L vibes.
[2 Nephi 24:12] Yo Lucifer, son of the morning, how'd you tumble from heaven like that? You got knocked down hard, even though you used to flex on the nations.
[2 Nephi 24:13] You said in your head, "I'm gonna climb to heaven, boost my throne above God's stars, and chill on the mount of the squad up north."
[2 Nephi 24:14] You said, "I'm climbing past the clouds' peaks, gonna flex like the Most High himself."
[2 Nephi 24:15] But no cap, you're gonna get dragged down to hell, straight to the edge of the pit.
[2 Nephi 24:16] Folks who spot you will low-key stare, debating, "Is this the same dude who shook the earth and flexed on kingdoms?"
[2 Nephi 24:17] The one who turned the world into a ghost town, wrecked cities, and left his prisoners locked up tight with no bailout?
[2 Nephi 24:18] All the kings from every nation? Yeah, they're all chillin' in glory, each vibing in their own crib.
[2 Nephi 24:19] But you? You're tossed from your grave like a nasty branch, with the rest of the slain, sword-pierced, sliding down to the pit's rocks...just a corpse getting stomped on like trash.
[2 Nephi 24:20] You ain't getting buried with them 'cause you wrecked your own land and killed your own crew; bad seeds like you? No legacy, no clout, just ghosted forever.
[2 Nephi 24:21] Set up the wipeout for his kids 'cause of their dads' sins, so they don't bounce back, claim the land, or blow up the world with cities.
[2 Nephi 24:22] God of Hosts says, "I'm coming in hot against them...cutting Babylon's name, leftovers, sons, and nephews out like they never existed."
[2 Nephi 24:23] God of Hosts declares, "I'm turning that place into a hangout for bitterns and swamps, sweeping it clean with my destruction broom, no cap."
[2 Nephi 24:24] God of Hosts swears, "What I planned? It's happening for real; my purpose? It's locked in, no cap."
[2 Nephi 24:25] I'm gonna bring the Assyrian into my turf and stomp him flat on my mountains...then his yoke and burden get yeeted off their backs for good.
[2 Nephi 24:26] This plan's global...no cap...and this is the reach I'm flexing over every nation out there.
[2 Nephi 24:27] God of Hosts made the call...who's really gonna cancel that? His hand's outstretched, and who's got the power to pull it back?
[2 Nephi 24:28] This whole weight dropped the same year King Ahaz checked out.
[2 Nephi 24:29] Don't start partying, whole Palestina, just 'cause your opp's stick got snapped; from that snake's root, a cockatrice pops up, and it spits out a fiery flying serpent ready to mess stuff up.
[2 Nephi 24:30] The poor's firstborn gonna eat up, the needy gonna chill safe, but I'm wiping out your roots with famine, and your leftovers? They're done for.
[2 Nephi 24:31] Gates, start howling; city, start crying...Palestina's breaking down hard; smoke's rolling in from the north, and no one's flying solo when the time's up.
[2 Nephi 24:32] When the nations' messengers ask, what's the move? The answer's clear: God built Zion tight, and the poor are gonna vibe and trust in it.
[2 Nephi 25:1] So yeah, it's me, Nephi, spilling some tea on Isaiah's words I wrote down...he was dropping heavy stuff that threw my people off 'cause they didn't get how Jews roll with prophesying.
[2 Nephi 25:2] I, Nephi, kept it low-key on teaching their Jewish ways 'cause their moves were straight-up dark vibes and full-on abominations, no cap.
[2 Nephi 25:3] So I'm writing to my crew, and anyone who reads this later, so y'all know God's judgments hit every nation exactly like He said...say less.
[2 Nephi 25:4] Yo, my Israel fam, listen up...Isaiah's words might be sus to you, but to anyone rocking the spirit of prophecy, they're clear as day. I'm dropping prophecies straight from the vibe I've had since bouncing from Jerusalem with my dad; real talk, I'm all about keeping it 100 so y'all actually get it.
[2 Nephi 25:5] For real, my soul vibes hard with Isaiah's words 'cause I left Jerusalem and peeped the Jews' ways...they get the prophets like no cap; no other crew grasps those prophecies unless they're schooled in Jewish style.
[2 Nephi 25:6] But listen, I, Nephi, didn't school my kids in Jewish ways; still, since I straight-up lived in Jerusalem and know the neighborhoods, I told my kids about God's judgments on the Jews...just like Isaiah said...but I'm not spilling all that in writing.
[2 Nephi 25:7] So yeah, I'm dropping my own prophecy straight-up and clear...no way to mess it up; but when Isaiah's prophecies go down for real, folks will know for sure when it's happening.
[2 Nephi 25:8] These words are straight-up valuable for everyone, but if anyone doubts that, I'll keep it real and speak just to my own people...'cause when the last days hit, they'll get it, and that's why I wrote this for their own good.
[2 Nephi 25:9] Just like one Jewish generation got wiped out for their sins, the same thing kept happening again and again...no surprise, prophets already spilled the tea beforehand.
[2 Nephi 25:10] So right after my dad dipped from Jerusalem, they got the heads-up about their doom, but they went full stubborn mode; no cap, just like I prophesied, they got wrecked...except for the ones taken captive to Babylon.
[2 Nephi 25:11] I'm saying this straight from the spirit inside me...though they've been exiled, they'll bounce back and reclaim Jerusalem, sliding right back into their OG inheritance.
[2 Nephi 25:12] Bet, they're gonna face wars and all that noisy drama, and when the Only Begotten of the Father...real OG of heaven and earth...shows up in person, they'll ghost him hard 'cause their sins got them stuck with stiff necks and zero rizz.
[2 Nephi 25:13] Watch, they'll crucify him, but after three days in the tomb, he's gonna bounce back with healing vibes flying around; anyone who trusts his name catches the W and makes it to God's kingdom. No cap, my soul's hyped to prophecy about him 'cause I've seen his day, and my heart's all about hyping his holy name.
[2 Nephi 25:14] Peep this: after the Messiah rises and pops up to anyone who's down with his name, Jerusalem's gonna get wrecked again...big L for anyone beefing with God and his crew.
[2 Nephi 25:15] So yeah, the Jews are gonna get scattered all over the map; and Babylon's gonna catch its own L, which leads to the Jews getting spread out by other nations too.
[2 Nephi 25:16] After they get scattered and God lets other nations throw shade on them for generations, eventually they'll catch the vibe and believe in Christ, the Son of God, and his infinite atonement for everyone ... and when that day hits, they'll worship the Father straight-up with pure hearts, no cap looking for any other Messiah; that's when it's all gotta make sense.
[2 Nephi 25:17] God's gonna flex again, round two, to bring his people back from their lost, busted state, pulling off some next-level miracles and straight-up wonders among humanity.
[2 Nephi 25:18] So God's gonna drop His words on them, and those words are gonna judge them on the last day; they're meant to convince them the true Messiah...the one they ghosted...is the real deal, and they better stop scrolling for another Messiah 'cause any new one's just fake news; prophets only hyped one Messiah, and that's the same one the Jews rejected.
[2 Nephi 25:19] Prophets said the Messiah's drop date is 600 years after my dad left Jerusalem, and both prophets and God's angel said his name's Jesus Christ, the Son of God...say less.
[2 Nephi 25:20] Yo, fam, I'm laying it out so y'all can't mess up. Just like God, who flexed by pulling Israel outta Egypt, gave Moses the power to heal people bitten by venomous snakes if they just peeped the serpent he lifted, and smacked the rock to give water...same vibe, no cap: the only name under heaven that saves is Jesus Christ, no receipts needed.
[2 Nephi 25:21] So yeah, God promised me this: what I'm writing will be saved and passed down through my fam forever, making sure Joseph's line never fades while Earth's still spinning.
[2 Nephi 25:22] These truths will flex through generations as long as Earth's up, rolling with God's vibe; and whoever holds them will catch judgment based on the written words, no cap.
[2 Nephi 25:23] We grind hard writing to convince our kids and squad to believe in Christ and link back with God, 'cause real talk, salvation's all grace after we do our part...say less.
[2 Nephi 25:24] Even though we're all in on Christ, we're still riding with Moses' law, eyes locked on Christ until that law's fully done and dusted.
[2 Nephi 25:25] The law was dropped for this exact reason; so yeah, the law's basically dead to us, and we're living it up in Christ 'cause of faith...but we still stick to the law 'cause commandments, no cap.
[2 Nephi 25:26] We're all about Christ...talking, hyping, preaching, prophesying, and writing our visions so our kids know exactly where to cop forgiveness for their sins.
[2 Nephi 25:27] So we drop knowledge on the law to show our kids it's dead weight, hoping they look forward to the life in Christ and get why the law was even given ... and once Christ finishes the law, they won't go sus and block him when the law's gotta go.
[2 Nephi 25:28] Alright fam, y'all been mad stubborn, so I'm straight up with you...no cap, no excuses. These words I dropped? They're receipts against you, clear enough to teach anyone the vibe: believe in Christ and don't ghost him; denying Him means you're also throwing shade on the prophets and the law.
[2 Nephi 25:29] Listen up, the real flex is believing in Christ and not denying Him; He's the Holy One of Israel, so you gotta bow down and worship Him with all your vibe...mind, strength, soul...and if you do, you won't get ghosted, no cap.
[2 Nephi 25:30] Whenever it's needed, keep up God's rituals and ordinances until Moses' law is fully done and dusted...stay on that grind.
[2 Nephi 26:1] After Christ flexes the resurrection, He'll show up to you, my kids and fam, and the words He drops will be the law y'all gotta live by...no cap.
[2 Nephi 26:2] Real talk, I've seen many generations will roll through with major beefs and wars popping off among my people.
[2 Nephi 26:3] After the Messiah drops, signs about His birth, death, and bounce-back will hit my people; that day's gonna be straight-up awful for the wicked...they'll get wiped out 'cause they ghosted prophets and saints, even threw stones and killed 'em; so the blood cries out to God, no cap.
[2 Nephi 26:4] So yeah, all the cocky sinners? That day's gonna roast them like nothing, says the Lord of Hosts...they'll be straight-up stubble, no lie.
[2 Nephi 26:5] Anyone who offs the prophets and saints? The earth's gonna straight-up swallow them, says the Lord of Hosts; mountains, storms, and falling buildings will crush and grind them to dust...no cap.
[2 Nephi 26:6] They're gonna get hit with thunder, lightning, earthquakes, and all kinds of chaos 'cause God's rage fire's lit against them...they'll be like dry grass, and that day will straight-up burn them up, says the Lord of Hosts.
[2 Nephi 26:7] Bro, my soul's legit wrecked over my people getting slaughtered! I've seen it, and it's almost crushing me in front of the Lord, but I gotta keep yelling to God: Your ways are straight-up fair.
[2 Nephi 26:8] But check it, the real ones who listen to prophets, don't cancel them, and keep their eyes on Christ through all the hate...they're the ones who won't cap out.
[2 Nephi 26:9] The Son of Righteousness will show up to them, fix them up, and vibe in peace with them until three generations bounce, and plenty of the fourth are still flexing righteousness.
[2 Nephi 26:10] After all that fades, a fast destruction hits my people; even though it wrecks my soul, I've seen it for real...no cap. They sell out for nothing, chasing pride and dumb moves, so they get wrecked; since they side with the devil and pick darkness over light, they're headed straight to hell.
[2 Nephi 26:11] The Spirit of the Lord won't always vibe with humans; once it dips, fast destruction shows up...and that low-key breaks my soul.
[2 Nephi 26:12] Like I said about getting the Jews to see that Jesus is the real Christ, the Gentiles gotta catch that too...Jesus is the Eternal God, say less.
[2 Nephi 26:13] He shows up to everyone who believes, powered by the Holy Ghost; flexing miracles, signs, and wonders across every nation, group, language, and squad, matching their faith vibes.
[2 Nephi 26:14] Yo, I'm dropping prophecy about the last days...when the Lord God's gonna reveal all this stuff to the kids of men.
[2 Nephi 26:15] After my crew and my bros' squad fade in unbelief and get clapped by the Gentiles; after God sets up camp around them, sieging with forts and mountains; after they're crushed to dust like they don't even exist...still, the righteous's words get penned, faithful prayers get heard, and those who lost faith ain't getting ghosted.
[2 Nephi 26:16] Even those wiped out will talk from the dirt, their voices low like a familiar spirit; God'll give someone the power to whisper their stories straight up from the ground, their words coming outta the dust.
[2 Nephi 26:17] The Lord God says: They'll write down all that happens, seal it up in a book, and the unbelievers who wanna erase God's stuff won't get their hands on it.
[2 Nephi 26:18] So like those who got wrecked got wrecked fast, and their scary squads will blow away like chaff...yeah, God's saying it's gonna hit suddenly, no cap.
[2 Nephi 26:19] Then the unbelievers who faded out will get clapped by the Gentiles, no cap.
[2 Nephi 26:20] The Gentiles got mad pride, trippped hard over their own huge stumbling block...building tons of churches but flexing fake power, trashing God's miracles, and hyping their own brainpower just to make bank off the poor.
[2 Nephi 26:21] Tons of churches pop up causing all the envy, beef, and straight-up bad vibes.
[2 Nephi 26:22] Plus, there's secret squads just like back in the day, all devil-built...he's the OG of murder and shady moves, pulling them by the neck with a weak-ass cord till he locks them down tight forever.
[2 Nephi 26:23] Yo, my beloved bros, real talk...God ain't about that darkness life.
[2 Nephi 26:24] God doesn't do shady stuff...everything's for the world's glow-up; He loves the world so hard He gave His own life to pull everyone in. So, He's not out here blocking anyone from His salvation...say less.
[2 Nephi 26:25] Does He yell at anyone like, "Get lost"? Nah fam, He's all like, "Come thru, all corners of the earth...get that milk and honey, no cap, no cash needed."
[2 Nephi 26:26] Yo, has He ever told anyone to bounce from synagogues or worship spots? Nah, no way.
[2 Nephi 26:27] Has He ever told anyone to skip His salvation? No cap, never. He's dropped it free for everyone and told His crew to convince all to bounce back to Him.
[2 Nephi 26:28] Has God ever flexed and said, "You can't have my goodness"? Nah fam, everyone's got the same shot, no one's blocked.
[2 Nephi 26:29] He shuts down priestcrafts...those clout-chasers preaching just to flex and rake in cash and hype, ignoring Zion's real glow-up.
[2 Nephi 26:30] God straight-up banned that fake hustle; He said everyone gotta flex charity...that's real love. Without it, you're nada. If they had charity, no way they'd let Zion's workers drop dead.
[2 Nephi 26:31] Zion's workers gotta grind for Zion, not the cash...if they hustle for money, they're gonna crash and burn.
[2 Nephi 26:32] God's rules? No murder, no cap lies, no stealing, no disrespecting His name, no envy, no bad vibes, no beef, no sketchy hookups...break any, and you're straight up doomed.
[2 Nephi 26:33] None of this sus behavior is from God; He only vibes good with humans, keeping it clear for everyone. He's inviting all to cop His goodness...no cap, no exclusions...black, white, slave, free, dude, or dudette. He even remembers the heathens; everyone's equal in God's eyes, Jew and Gentile alike.
[2 Nephi 27:1] Peep this: in the last days, when Gentiles run the show...all nations, Jews included, whether here or worldwide...they'll be straight-up wasted on sin and mad sus abominations.
[2 Nephi 27:2] When that day drops, the Lord of Hosts will roll up with thunder, earthquakes, mad noise, storms, tempests, and fire that straight up devours.
[2 Nephi 27:3] Any nation beefing with Zion? They'll be like a trippy nightmare...hungry dude dreams he eats but wakes up starving, thirsty dude dreams he drinks but still parched. Same vibe for anyone messing with Mount Zion...they get played every time.
[2 Nephi 27:4] Yo, all you sinners, pause and catch these feels...you're gonna cry hard, stumbling like you're wasted but it ain't no alcohol messing with you.
[2 Nephi 27:5] God's dropped a mad sleep spell on y'all 'cause you shut your eyes, ghosted the prophets, and He blocked your leaders and seers 'cause you been straight-up sus with your sins.
[2 Nephi 27:6] Watch, God's gonna drop a book with the real talk from those who've been snoozing before.
[2 Nephi 27:7] Peep this: the book's sealed tight, holding God's full drop...from day one to the world's finale, no cap.
[2 Nephi 27:8] Since some stuff's locked down tight, it won't get spilled during the peak of all the wickedness and sus acts; so the book stays on lockdown from those peeps.
[2 Nephi 27:9] The book's gonna land in one dude's hands, and he'll flex the words from those who've been sleeping in the dirt, then pass that fire to someone else.
[2 Nephi 27:10] He won't spill the sealed words or hand over the sealed book ... God's got that locked down tight. The full reveal stays in the book till the Lord's timing is spot-on, 'cause it drops all the tea from the world's start to finish.
[2 Nephi 27:11] The day's gonna come when the sealed words get shouted from the rooftops, powered by Christ, spilling all the secrets to everyone who's ever lived or will live till the world ends.
[2 Nephi 27:12] So when the book lands with that dude I mentioned, it'll be on stealth mode...only three witnesses plus the guy holding it get the God-powered peek, and they'll vouch hard for the book's truth.
[2 Nephi 27:13] No one else gets a look unless God says so, just a select few flexing to confirm His word, 'cause the Lord said the faithful's words gotta hit like they're speaking from the grave.
[2 Nephi 27:14] God's gonna drop the book's words, backed by however many witnesses He wants, and trust...anyone who ghosts God's word is in big trouble, no cap.
[2 Nephi 27:15] So God's gonna tell the dude with the book: flex the unsealed words to someone else who'll show them to the educated crowd, and the brainiacs will be like, "Yo, gimme the book, I'm about to read this."
[2 Nephi 27:16] But low-key, they'll front like they're about God's glory when really they just chasing clout and cash, no cap.
[2 Nephi 27:17] That guy will hit back with, "Nah fam, I can't flex the book...it's sealed tight."
[2 Nephi 27:18] Then the brainiacs gonna be like, "Bruh, I can't read this."
[2 Nephi 27:19] So God's gonna drop the book and its words to some dude who's not bougie or educated, and that guy will be like, "Honestly, I'm no genius."
[2 Nephi 27:20] Then God's gonna tell him, "The brainiacs ain't getting these 'cause they dipped on 'em, but I got this...so you're gonna read the words I drop for you."
[2 Nephi 27:21] Don't mess with the sealed stuff yet; I'll flex that at the right time to show everyone I run my own show, no cap.
[2 Nephi 27:22] So after you read the words I gave you and get the receipts I promised, seal the book back up and stash it for me...I'll keep the unread stuff safe until I decide to spill the tea to everyone.
[2 Nephi 27:23] Look, I'm God...big on miracles...and I'll prove I'm the same OG yesterday, today, and always; I only flex for people who got that faith energy.
[2 Nephi 27:24] And then God's gonna hit up the dude reading the words He drops with a message, say less.
[2 Nephi 27:25] These folks act all respectful with their words, but their hearts are straight ghosting me; their respect's just some fake script learned from humans.
[2 Nephi 27:26] So I'm about to pull a next-level move on these people...a straight-up marvel...where the so-called wise and educated get played, and the smart ones' understanding goes MIA.
[2 Nephi 27:27] Yo, mad curse on those who low-key hide their schemes from God, thinking no one sees their shady moves; they're like, "Who even knows us?" and "Your chaos is just clay to mold." But watch, says the Lord of Hosts, I peep all their grind...like, does the work say "I made myself"? Or the creator get called clueless? Nah, that's straight sus.
[2 Nephi 27:28] Yo, says the Lord of Hosts, soon enough Lebanon's gonna glow up from just trees to a whole lush farm, and that farm's gonna flex like a dense forest...say less.
[2 Nephi 27:29] When that time drops, even the deaf will catch the book's words, and blind eyes will glow up, seeing clear out the shadows and darkness.
[2 Nephi 27:30] The humble gonna level up, vibing with pure joy in the Lord, and the broke folks will flex happiness in the Holy One of Israel.
[2 Nephi 27:31] Deadass, as long as the Lord's alive, they'll peep that the big bad gets wrecked, the haters get roasted, and all the shady watchers get yeeted.
[2 Nephi 27:32] And those who drag a dude down just for his words, setting traps for the ones calling out the truth, and throw the innocent under the bus over nothing...big sus.
[2 Nephi 27:33] So, says the Lord who saved Abraham, Jacob's crew won't be shook or turn ghost-faced no more, bet.
[2 Nephi 27:34] When he peeps his kids...the real MVPs made by me right there...they'll hype up my name, flex the Holy One of Jacob, and low-key respect the God of Israel.
[2 Nephi 27:35] Even the ones who were spiritually lost will catch the vibe, and the constant complainers will finally get schooled in the real deal.
[2 Nephi 28:1] Yo fam, I dropped these truths 'cause the Spirit had me no-chillin', so trust me, these things are 100% gonna happen, no cap.
[2 Nephi 28:2] The stuff dropped in the book's gonna be straight-up valuable for all humanity, especially for our crew...the leftover squad of Israel.
[2 Nephi 28:3] On that day, churches built for clout, not God, will flex like, "I'm the Lord's," and the others will flex the same, all hyping themselves instead of the Lord...big cringe energy.
[2 Nephi 28:4] They'll beef nonstop, even their priests throwing shade at each other, schooling with book smarts but ghosting the Holy Ghost who's the real plug for truth.
[2 Nephi 28:5] They straight-up deny God's power, the Holy One of Israel, telling the crowd, "Listen to us, our rules are the move; God's done his thing and passed the power to humans," low-key flexing like God's off-duty.
[2 Nephi 28:6] Listen up: if anyone claims the Lord's pulling off miracles now, don't buy it...today He's not about that miracle life; His job's already done.
[2 Nephi 28:7] Facts, tons will be like, "Eat, drink, vibe hard, 'cause we dying tomorrow; no stress, we Gucci."
[2 Nephi 28:8] Plenty will say, "Eat, drink, vibe, but low-key fear God...he's chill with some minor sinning, like small lies, flexing on people, even throwing shade with traps; it's no biggie since we die tomorrow, and if we catch heat, God's just gonna give us a light spanking before saving us anyway."
[2 Nephi 28:9] For real, many will rant dumb, fake doctrines, flexing mad ego, trying to low-key ghost the Lord on their plans, and their moves will be straight-up sus and shady.
[2 Nephi 28:10] The saints' blood will be straight-up screaming from the dirt, throwing major receipts on them.
[2 Nephi 28:11] Yup, they all dipped from the path and got mad corrupted, no cap.
[2 Nephi 28:12] Pride and fake teachers cooked their churches into corruption, now they're all hyped up and flexing hard because of that ego boost.
[2 Nephi 28:13] They're snatching from the poor to fund their boujee sanctuaries and drip, and they bully the humble 'cause their pride's got them mad inflated.
[2 Nephi 28:14] They're walking around all stiff-necked and high-headed, flexing pride, wickedness, and nasty vibes, totally off the path except a rare few humble Christ fans...but even they trip up 'cause they catch the wrong lessons from humans.
[2 Nephi 28:15] Yo, the smart flexers, rich egos, fake preachers, and all the sinners twisting God's path...God Almighty says, big woah to them; they're getting dragged straight to hell, no cap!
[2 Nephi 28:16] Big woah to those who throw shade at the righteous over nothing and diss what's good like it's worthless...'cause the day's coming when God's gonna hit Earth quick, and when everyone's peak sinning, they're straight-up done.
[2 Nephi 28:17] But check it, if Earth's squad bounces from their messed-up ways and gross acts, they're not getting wiped out, God of Hosts says say less.
[2 Nephi 28:18] Bet, that huge, nasty church...the world's biggest whore...gonna straight-up crash and burn hard, big fall incoming.
[2 Nephi 28:19] The devil's kingdom's gotta shake up, and its crew will either have to repent or get caught in his eternal chains, fueled by rage, ending in total wipeout.
[2 Nephi 28:20] On that day, he's gonna rage hard in people's hearts, hyping them to clown on what's good.
[2 Nephi 28:21] Some he'll chill out and lull into comfy sin vibes, flexing "All good in Zion, we straight," but that's the devil playing them, sneaking their souls on a smooth ride straight to hell.
[2 Nephi 28:22] Then he smooth-talks some, saying hell's a myth and "I ain't no devil, hell don't exist," whispering lies until he's got them locked tight in chains with zero escape.
[2 Nephi 28:23] Yeah, they get snatched by death, hell, the devil...they all gotta face God's throne and get judged for their deeds, then get sent to their spot: an endless, flaming lake of fire and brimstone, pure torment.
[2 Nephi 28:24] So, big woah to anyone too comfy and chillin' in Zion like everything's Gucci.
[2 Nephi 28:25] Big woah to the ones shouting, "All is well!" like they blind to the mess around.
[2 Nephi 28:26] Deadass woah to anyone vibing with human rules over God's power and ghostin' the Holy Spirit's gifts.
[2 Nephi 28:27] Straight up disaster for anyone flexing like, "We good, got all we need," shutting the door on more blessings.
[2 Nephi 28:28] No cap, woah to those shook and salty over God's truth; those on solid rock vibe with it, but the ones on shaky sand keep stressin' they might collapse.
[2 Nephi 28:29] Major L for anyone saying, "We got God's word, no cap, we don't need more," acting like that's the full flex.
[2 Nephi 28:30] God says, I'm dropping knowledge line by line, bit by bit; if you listen up and vibe with my tips, you'll get mad wisdom...but those flexing "We've got enough" will lose even what they had.
[2 Nephi 28:31] Deadass cursed is anyone trusting humans or flexing on human rules...unless those rules are powered by the Holy Ghost, they ain't legit.
[2 Nephi 28:32] God's like, big woah to the Gentiles...I've been reaching out nonstop but they keep ghosting me; still, I'm ready to forgive if they switch up and slide back to me, 'cause my arm's always outstretched, no cap.
[2 Nephi 29:1] Look, when I drop this epic comeback move, remembering my promises to humanity, I'm hitting reset to pull back my peeps from Israel's crew for round two.
[2 Nephi 29:2] Also, I won't forget the promises I made to you, Nephi, and your pops...that your fam's words will drop straight from my mouth to yours, spreading like fire worldwide as a banner for my Israel crew.
[2 Nephi 29:3] When my words start flexing everywhere, a bunch of Gentiles will be like, "A Bible! A Bible! We got the Bible, no cap, no more Bibles needed."
[2 Nephi 29:4] But God says, "Yo fools, yeah they got a Bible straight from my OG squad, the Jews. Yet the Gentiles act like, 'Thanks, but nah.' Do they even remember the grind, sweat, and pain the Jews went through to drop salvation for the Gentiles?"
[2 Nephi 29:5] Yo Gentiles, did y'all remember the Jews, my OG covenant crew? Nah, you cursed and hated them, no effort to bring them back. Bet, I'm gonna clap back on y'all...God's not forgot about his people.
[2 Nephi 29:6] Bro, if you're out here saying, "We got the Bible, no cap, we don't need more," did you even get that Bible without the Jews? Think again.
[2 Nephi 29:7] Don't forget, there's way more nations out there; I, the Lord, made all humans, I got receipts on those chillin' on sea isles, ruling both sky and ground, dropping my word to everyone worldwide.
[2 Nephi 29:8] So why you mad about getting more of my word? Don't you know two nations testifying is proof I'm God, remembering all equally? I drop the same vibes to each, and when these two nations merge, their testimony links up too.
[2 Nephi 29:9] I do this to show I'm the same OG from back then to now and always, dropping words whenever I vibe; just 'cause I said one thing don't mean I can't say more...my grind ain't over till the end of time and then some.
[2 Nephi 29:10] Just 'cause you got a Bible don't mean it's got all my words; don't sleep on the fact that I've had more stuff written down too.
[2 Nephi 29:11] I'm telling everyone everywhere...east, west, north, south, even island vibes...to write down what I say, 'cause I'll judge the whole world based on those books and what folks do.
[2 Nephi 29:12] Look, I'm hitting up the Jews who'll write it down; the Nephites too; plus the other Israel tribes I guided...they're on it; and all the nations worldwide? They're writing my words too.
[2 Nephi 29:13] So, the Jews will get the Nephites' words, the Nephites get the Jews' words, and both squad up with the lost tribes' words...and those lost tribes get the Nephites' and Jews' words too.
[2 Nephi 29:14] My Israel crew's gonna get scooped back to their lands, and my word's gonna be pulled together. I'll shut down anyone throwing shade at my word or people, proving I'm God and that I promised Abraham I'd never ghost his fam.
[2 Nephi 30:1] Yo, my fam, Nephi here...don't think you're more woke than the Gentiles; if you don't keep God's commandments, you're gonna crash too. And just 'cause I said stuff, don't assume Gentiles are totally done for.
[2 Nephi 30:2] Listen up: any Gentiles who hit that repentance glow-up become God's squad, but Jews who don't repent get sidelined...'cause God only vibes with those who repent and put faith in His Son, the Holy One of Israel.
[2 Nephi 30:3] So here's the tea: after the book I mentioned drops for the Gentiles and gets sealed back to the Lord, tons will vibe with those words and spread them to the leftover fam of our seed.
[2 Nephi 30:4] Then the leftover fam will peep that we bounced from Jerusalem and that they're straight-up descendants of the Jews.
[2 Nephi 30:5] The gospel of Jesus Christ will get dropped on them, so they'll get clued back into their ancestors' vibes and the knowledge of Jesus that ran deep with their dads.
[2 Nephi 30:6] Then they'll flex big time, realizing God's hand blessed them; their blindfolds drop, and before many gens, they'll be a pure, hella wholesome crew.
[2 Nephi 30:7] The scattered Jews will start catching feels for Christ and pull back together across the land, and anyone who vibes with Christ will become a delightsome crew too.
[2 Nephi 30:8] God's about to kick off His mission worldwide...every nation, tribe, language, and squad...bringing His people back together on Earth, no cap.
[2 Nephi 30:9] God's gonna judge the poor right and call out the humble fair and square. He'll strike the earth with words alone and wipe out the wicked just by speaking.
[2 Nephi 30:10] Real soon, God's gonna split the crowd hard...destroying the wicked but sparing His people, even if He gotta burn the bad apples to do it.
[2 Nephi 30:11] Righteousness will be His waist strap, and faithfulness will hold His core tight...say less, that's main-character energy.
[2 Nephi 30:12] Soon the wolf's gonna chill with the lamb, leopards will crash with the kids, calves, young lions, and fatlings...all vibing...led by a little kid flexing total boss energy.
[2 Nephi 30:13] Cows and bears will share snacks, their babies will nap side by side, and lions will be munching on grass like oxen...no cap, total peace vibes.
[2 Nephi 30:14] Babies fresh off the teat will be chillin' on deadly snake spots, and toddlers will vibe with cockatrice dens...mad fearless energy.
[2 Nephi 30:15] No cap, nobody's gonna throw hands or wreck stuff on God's holy mountain; the Earth will be packed with God's knowledge like waves filling the sea.
[2 Nephi 30:16] So look, all the tea from every nation gonna be spilled, and everything's gonna be out there for all people to know...no receipts left hidden.
[2 Nephi 30:17] No cap, nothing stays secret forever; all shady stuff gets exposed in the light, and anything locked down on earth will be unlocked, say less.
[2 Nephi 30:18] So on that day, all revealed truths will drop, and Satan's gonna lose all clout over people's hearts for real, at least for a long minute. Aight, that's my last word, fam.
[2 Nephi 31:1] Aight, I'm Nephi, wrapping up my prophecy vibes to y'all, my beloved fam. I can only drop a few truths that for sure gonna happen, and just a peek at my bro Jacob's words too.
[2 Nephi 31:2] So yeah, what I've written hits the mark, but I gotta drop a couple more lines about Christ's doctrine...gonna keep it 100 and straightforward, no cap.
[2 Nephi 31:3] My soul's all about that straight-up clarity; that's how God rolls with us...dropping knowledge in our own language so we actually get it, no cap.
[2 Nephi 31:4] So remember I told you about that prophet God showed me...he's the one who's gonna baptize the Lamb of God, the real MVP taking away the world's sins, say less.
[2 Nephi 31:5] So, if the holy Lamb of God had to get baptized with water to check all the boxes, then for real, us unholy folks need baptism even more, no cap!
[2 Nephi 31:6] Yo, my beloved fam, where exactly did the Lamb of God flex fulfilling all righteousness by getting dunked in water?
[2 Nephi 31:7] Don't forget, he was holy AF, but still humbled himself in the flesh, showing the Father he's down to obey and keep the commandments...main-character energy, no cap.
[2 Nephi 31:8] So after he got baptized with water, the Holy Ghost slid down on him like a dove, no cap.
[2 Nephi 31:9] Also, it's like a vibe check showing everyone the path's super narrow and gate's tight...but he blazed that trail first, setting the example.
[2 Nephi 31:10] He told everyone straight up: "Follow me." So, fam, can we really ride with Jesus if we ain't down to keep the Father's commandments? Big nope.
[2 Nephi 31:11] The Father was like, "Repent, repent, and get baptized rep good in the name of my Beloved Son," say less.
[2 Nephi 31:12] Then the Son hit me up saying, "Whoever gets baptized in my name gets the Holy Ghost from the Father, just like me. So, follow my lead and do what you've seen me do," bet.
[2 Nephi 31:13] So listen up, fam...I know if you follow the Son with a 100% real heart, no fake flex, actually repenting and showing the Father you're down to rep Christ's name by baptism...like literally going under just like He said...then you'll catch the Holy Ghost, that fire baptism, and start vibing with angelic talk, shouting mad props to the Holy One of Israel.
[2 Nephi 31:14] But peep this, fam: the Son told me that after you've repented, shown the Father you're down to keep His commandments by water baptism, caught that fire and Holy Ghost vibe, and can even speak angel-speak...if you then deny Him, it'd have been straight-up better if you never knew Him at all.
[2 Nephi 31:15] Heard the Father say straight up: "My Beloved's words are deadass true and loyal. Anyone who sticks it out till the end? They're getting that W...saved for real."
[2 Nephi 31:16] So fam, I'm telling you straight...if you don't keep grinding till the end, following the Son of the living God's example, there's no way you're getting saved, no cap.
[2 Nephi 31:17] So do what I said...I seen your Lord and Redeemer do it...'cause that's how I know the gate you gotta enter. The gate's repentance and water baptism, then fire and the Holy Ghost wipe your sins clean, no cap.
[2 Nephi 31:18] Then you're on that tight, narrow path to eternal life...entered through the gate, followed the Father's and Son's commands, and got the Holy Ghost confirming the promise that if you take that route, you're set.
[2 Nephi 31:19] So fam, now that you're on this narrow path, you think that's the whole deal? Nah. You didn't make it this far without riding the word of Christ with mad unshaken faith, counting fully on the One who's got the power to save.
[2 Nephi 31:20] So, you gotta keep pushing with solid Christ vibes, mad hope shining bright, and love for God and everyone. If you keep grinding, feeding on Christ's word, and hold it down till the end, the Father says straight up: eternal life's yours, no cap.
[2 Nephi 31:21] Yo, listen up fam...this the only way, no cap, no other route or name under heaven gets you saved in God's kingdom. This is the doctrine of Christ...the one true vibe from the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, all one God, forever. Amen.
[2 Nephi 32:1] Yo, my beloved fam, I bet y'all low-key stressing about what to do next after stepping into the way. But fr, why you letting those thoughts run wild in your head?
[2 Nephi 32:2] Remember when I said once you catch the Holy Ghost, you'll be speaking angel talk? So how you gonna spit that fire without the Holy Ghost backing you up?
[2 Nephi 32:3] Angels flex through the Holy Ghost, dropping Christ's words. So yeah, I told you to feast on Christ's words 'cause they serve up the whole playbook on what moves to make.
[2 Nephi 32:4] So here's the tea: if you don't get these words, it's 'cause you ain't asked or knocked...no hustle, no receipts. That means you're stuck in the dark and gotta perish there, no cap.
[2 Nephi 32:5] Real talk, if you step into the way and snag the Holy Ghost, it'll low-key show you every move you need to make, no cap.
[2 Nephi 32:6] This right here is Christ's doctrine, and no new tea drops till He shows up IRL. When He does, you better listen up and follow everything He says, no cap.
[2 Nephi 32:7] Aight, I'm out of words 'cause the Spirit shut me down, and I'm low-key mourning the unbelief, evil vibes, ignorance, and stubbornness of people who won't even look for or get the obvious knowledge served up straight.
[2 Nephi 32:8] I see y'all still caught up in your thoughts, and honestly, it pains me to say it: if you actually listened to the Spirit who schools you on prayer, you'd know you gotta pray. The haters? They wanna shut that down and say no praying, no cap.
[2 Nephi 32:9] Straight up, you gotta pray 24/7, no quitting. Before you do anything for the Lord, hit up the Father in Christ's name so your moves get blessed and boost your soul's glow-up.
[2 Nephi 33:1] Yo, I, Nephi, can't pen down all the gems taught to my crew; I ain't slick with the pen like I am with the mic, 'cause when I speak powered by the Holy Ghost, it hits straight in the feels of everyone listening.
[2 Nephi 33:2] But no cap, some folks harden up and block the Holy Spirit out, so it can't vibe with them; as a result, they trash a ton of what's written and treat it like straight-up nothing.
[2 Nephi 33:3] But me, Nephi, I wrote what I wrote and I low-key rate it as majorly important, especially for my people. I pray nonstop for them by day, my pillow's soaked from tears at night, and I hit up God in faith, knowing He's listening to my cries, no cap.
[2 Nephi 33:4] I'm sure the Lord God's gonna bless my prayers to help my people. The words I dropped, even if weak, will get strong for them...they push them to do good, remind them of their roots, hype up Jesus, and convince them to stay loyal till the end for eternal life.
[2 Nephi 33:5] My words clap back hard on sin, straight-up truth with no filter; so if anyone gets mad at what I wrote, they're def vibing with the devil's energy, no cap.
[2 Nephi 33:6] I flex on keeping it real, I flex on truth, and I flex on Jesus, 'cause He pulled my soul outta hell...major W energy.
[2 Nephi 33:7] I got mad love for my people and big faith in Christ that I'll roll up with a squad of spotless souls at His judgment-seat, no cap.
[2 Nephi 33:8] I got love for the Jew...saying Jew 'cause that's my own crew, where I come from, no cap.
[2 Nephi 33:9] Real talk, I care about the Gentiles too. But honestly, I can't hope for them unless they link up with Christ, slide through the narrow gate, stay on the tight path to life, and keep at it till the final judgment.
[2 Nephi 33:10] Yo, my beloved fam, Jews, and everyone everywhere, listen up and believe in Christ; if these words don't vibe with you, still believe in Christ. Believe in Him and you'll vibe with these words too, 'cause they're His words given to me, all about teaching folks to do good.
[2 Nephi 33:11] If these ain't Christ's words, then judge for yourselves...'cause on the last day, Christ will flex big time and prove they're His. You and I will face off before His court, and you'll see I was legit commanded by Him to write this, even with my flaws.
[2 Nephi 33:12] I'm praying to the Father, in Christ's name, that a bunch of us...if not all...make it into His kingdom on that final, epic day.
[2 Nephi 33:13] Yo, beloved fam of Israel and every corner of the earth, I'm out here shouting from the dust...peace out till that big day drops.
[2 Nephi 33:14] If you're not about that goodness of God, ignoring the Jews' words, mine, and everything coming from the Lamb of God's mouth, then I'm throwing you an eternal peace out...these words will roast you on judgment day, no cap.
[2 Nephi 33:15] Whatever I lock down on earth will pop off against you at the judgment bar; God's orders, and I gotta follow through. Amen.
[Jacob 1:1] So, 55 years had dipped since Lehi bounced from Jerusalem; then Nephi handed me, Jacob, the job to handle the small plates where all this tea is engraved.
[Jacob 1:2] Nephi told me, Jacob, to jot down just the most fire stuff on these plates...no cap, keep it tight and don't go deep into the whole history of the people called Nephi, just the highlights.
[Jacob 1:3] He said the full story's on his other plates, and my job is to keep these safe and pass 'em to my squad, generation after generation.
[Jacob 1:4] If there's sacred preaching, dope revelations, or solid prophecies, I gotta carve the main points on these plates and hit them as much as I can...for Christ and our people's sake.
[Jacob 1:5] 'Cause of our faith and mad anxiety, stuff for real got revealed to us about what's gonna go down with our people.
[Jacob 1:6] We caught tons of revelations and had the prophecy vibes strong; so yeah, we knew all about Christ and His kingdom rolling up.
[Jacob 1:7] So we hustled hard among our people, trying to get them to vibe with Christ and tap into God's goodness, so they could chill in His rest...'cause if not, God might get salty and block them like back in the wilderness with Israel's drama.
[Jacob 1:8] Fr, we wish we could convince everyone to not throw shade at God or make Him mad, but instead believe in Christ, see His sacrifice, carry His cross, and take the world's hate. So yeah, I'm Jacob, owning up to Nephi's command.
[Jacob 1:9] Nephi was getting old, peeping that death was near, so he hooked up a dude to be king and boss over the people, following the king vibes.
[Jacob 1:10] The people were mad about Nephi, 'cause he was their hype man...wielded Laban's sword to defend them and grind non-stop for their good all his days.
[Jacob 1:11] So the folks wanted to keep Nephi's name lit, calling whoever took his spot second Nephi, third Nephi, and so on, rolling with king titles no matter their real names.
[Jacob 1:12] And just like that, Nephi's time ran out...he died.
[Jacob 1:13] So, the folks not Lamanites were Nephites, but they also got tagged as Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, Zoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites...kinda sus with the name game.
[Jacob 1:14] But me, Jacob? I'm done playing name games...anyone trying to wreck Nephi's crew is Lamanite, and anyone riding with Nephi gets called Nephite or the people of Nephi, king titles and all.
[Jacob 1:15] Then, under the second king's reign, the Nephites started getting hard-hearted and low-key slipped into shady moves, flexing like OG David chasing mad wives and concubines, and Solomon, his son, doing the same.
[Jacob 1:16] Yeah, they also went full-on treasure hunters for gold and silver, then caught that pride bug and got all high-key arrogant.
[Jacob 1:17] So, I, Jacob, dropped these bars on them at the temple, only after getting the green light straight from the Lord.
[Jacob 1:18] Me and my bro Joseph got the priest and teacher glow-up, all courtesy of Nephi's blessing.
[Jacob 1:19] We leveled up our role, no cap, owning the hustle fully...if we slacked on teaching God's word hard, their sins would be on us, and their blood would stain our rep; so we grind to keep our robes clean for the last day.
[Jacob 2:1] Here's the tea Jacob, Nephi's bro, dropped on the Nephites after Nephi bounced.
[Jacob 2:2] Yo, fam, I'm Jacob, holding down my duty to God, trying to flex my role with seriousness and scrub your sins off my robes...so I rolled up to the temple today to spill God's word.
[Jacob 2:3] Y'all know I've been grinding hard in my role, but low-key today I'm carrying way more stress and worry for your souls than ever before.
[Jacob 2:4] Real talk, so far you've been pretty on point obeying the Lord's word I dropped on you.
[Jacob 2:5] But listen up...thanks to the almighty Creator of heaven and earth, I can peep your thoughts, and fam, y'all are starting to grind in sin, and that ish is straight-up disgusting to me and God, no cap.
[Jacob 2:6] Fr, it hits me deep and makes me wanna vanish from shame in front of my Maker 'cause I gotta call out the mess in your hearts.
[Jacob 2:7] Also, it low-key sucks that I gotta come at y'all with real talk in front of your wives and kids, who got mad pure and sensitive vibes before God...which God's all about, btw.
[Jacob 2:8] I'm thinking they rolled up here hoping to catch some good vibes from God's word, the stuff that actually heals broken souls.
[Jacob 2:9] So it's heavy on my soul that I gotta drop these harsh warnings 'cause God told me to, even if it just makes the hurt worse for those already hurting, and for the unscathed, instead of vibing with God's word, it feels like I'm stabbing their fragile minds with daggers.
[Jacob 2:10] Even though this job's mad heavy, I gotta follow God's strict orders and call out your wickedness and gross moves right in front of the pure-hearted, the broken-hearted, and under God's all-seeing eye, no cap.
[Jacob 2:11] So I gotta keep it 100 and spit God's word straight up. I asked the Lord, and He told me: Jacob, pull up to the temple tomorrow and drop the word I give you on these people.
[Jacob 2:12] So listen, fam, here's the word: lots of y'all started chasing gold and silver and all kinds of shiny stuff...this land, your promised spot for you and your fam, is loaded with that kinda flex.
[Jacob 2:13] Providence hooked y'all up with mad riches, but some of you got hella more than your bros, so you're flexing hard with big egos, stiff necks, high heads about your fancy drip, and low-key throwing shade at your own people thinking you're better.
[Jacob 2:14] So, fam, you really think God's cool with this? Nah, He straight-up calls you out, and if you keep it up, His judgment's coming at you ASAP.
[Jacob 2:15] Bet you don't realize He can hit you with just one glare and knock you flat on your ass!
[Jacob 2:16] For real, I wish He'd wipe out this gross mess from you, and you'd actually hear His commands instead of letting your big ego wreck your soul!
[Jacob 2:17] Treat your bros like yourself, stay tight with everyone, and share your stuff so they can glow up just like you.
[Jacob 2:18] But for real, before chasing clout and cash, chase the kingdom of God first.
[Jacob 2:19] Once you've got hope in Christ, you can score riches if you want...but only to do good vibes: hook up the naked, feed the hungry, free the captive, and help the sick and sad.
[Jacob 2:20] Alright, fam, I've been talking pride...if you've been dragging your neighbor down just 'cause you're flexing what God gave you, what you gotta say about that?
[Jacob 2:21] Don't you get that stuff's straight-up nasty to the Creator of all people? Every single person's just as precious to Him, all made from dust for the same reason...to follow His commandments and flex His glory forever.
[Jacob 2:22] I'm done ranting about pride for now, and honestly, if I didn't have a bigger mess to call out, my heart would be hyped for you all.
[Jacob 2:23] God's word hits me hard 'cause y'all's bigger sins are sus. The Lord says this crew's sliding into wickedness, twisting scriptures to justify their wild moves, all 'cause of what went down with David and his boy Solomon.
[Jacob 2:24] Look, David and Solomon stacked mad wives and concubines, but straight up, God calls that move disgusting.
[Jacob 2:25] So yeah, God says He hauled these people outta Jerusalem with His muscle to grow a righteous branch straight from Joseph's fam tree.
[Jacob 2:26] So listen up, I, the Lord God, ain't gonna let these people replay the old crew's messed-up moves.
[Jacob 2:27] So fam, listen close to the Lord's word: y'all get only one wife, no side chicks allowed, period.
[Jacob 2:28] God's real about this...He vibes with women keeping it pure, and cheating is straight-up disgusting in His eyes, no cap.
[Jacob 2:29] So the Lord of Hosts says, y'all better keep His commandments or this land's gonna catch a serious L because of you.
[Jacob 2:30] The Lord of Hosts says if He decides to bless his squad with kids, He'll lay down the law for them; if not, they'll just roll with whatever.
[Jacob 2:31] Look, I, the Lord, peeped the pain and heard the cries of my people's daughters in Jerusalem and everywhere else, all 'cause their husbands went full sus with wickedness and gross moves.
[Jacob 2:32] The Lord of Hosts ain't about to let the tears of my people's daughters...whom I rescued from Jerusalem...reach me as complaints against their men, no cap.
[Jacob 2:33] Heads up, the daughters of my people won't get snatched because they're gentle...unless I drop a heavy curse that wipes things out; no more whoredoms like back in the day, says the Lord of Hosts.
[Jacob 2:34] Yo fam, you know these rules came straight to our dad Lehi; so no cap, you've been warned but still caught mad L's for doing what you shouldn't have.
[Jacob 2:35] Real talk, y'all did worse dirty than the Lamanites, breaking your wives' hearts and losing your kids' trust 'cause you flexed mad bad vibes; their tears hit God loud, and His harsh word stabbed deep, leaving many hearts dead inside.
[Jacob 3:1] Yo, I'm Jacob, talking to the pure-hearted...stay locked in on God with steady mind, pray hard with mad faith, and He'll vibe with your struggles, back your case, and serve justice to anyone tryna end you.
[Jacob 3:2] Yo pure hearts, hold your heads high, soak in God's dope word, and feast on His love...if your mindset stays solid, this vibe lasts forever, no cap.
[Jacob 3:3] But fr, big yikes to the ones with dirty hearts right now...unless you bounce back, the land's cursed 'cause of you; even the Lamanites, who ain't as sus as you, will roast you hard until you're wiped out.
[Jacob 3:4] The clock's ticking fast...unless you repent, they're gonna snatch your land, and Lord God will haul the righteous outta your crew, no cap.
[Jacob 3:5] Look, the Lamanites...your bros you hate 'cause of their skin and curse...are actually more righteous than you; they kept Dad's rule tight: just one wife, no side chicks, and no whoredoms allowed.
[Jacob 3:6] Now, since they stick to this command, God won't ghost them but show mercy, and one day they're gonna glow up into a blessed squad.
[Jacob 3:7] Check it, their husbands and wives vibe with mad love, and they're all about their kids; their beef and distrust with you? That's old tea from their dads' mess-ups...so what makes you think you're any better in God's eyes?
[Jacob 3:8] Yo fam, low-key I'm worried ... if you don't shape up, their skins gonna be way whiter than yours when y'all roll up before God's throne.
[Jacob 3:9] So here's the word from God: stop throwing shade about their dark skin or their mess; instead, peep your own flaws and remember their dirtiness stems from their dads.
[Jacob 3:10] Remember your kids...how you broke their hearts with your ugly example; and real talk, your mess could drag them down to destruction, with their sins stacking on your head on Judgment Day.
[Jacob 3:11] Yo fam, listen up! Wake your souls the hell up, shake off that deathly sleep, break free from hell's grip, so you don't end up as the devil's minions getting tossed into that fire pit of second death.
[Jacob 3:12] So yeah, I, Jacob, hit up the Nephi peeps with real talk...no cap...calling out nasty vibes like fornication and all kinds of sin, spelling out the brutal fallout if they keep flexing like that.
[Jacob 3:13] No cap, only a tiny fraction of this crew's moves...since they're blowing up in number...is on these plates; the big stuff like wars, drama, and king reigns got logged on the bigger plates.
[Jacob 3:14] These are the plates of Jacob, handcrafted by Nephi's own hand...so yeah, that's me wrapping up my speech, say less.
[Jacob 4:1] So check it, I, Jacob, dropped mad knowledge to my people, but low-key can only write a bit 'cause engraving plates ain't easy; still, we know these plates gotta keep the receipts forever.
[Jacob 4:2] Anything we scribble anywhere but on plates is sus and will just disappear, but throwing down a few words on plates drops some knowledge bombs for our kids and fam about us and their roots.
[Jacob 4:3] We low-key hype about this and grind hard to carve these words on plates, hoping our fam and kids catch the vibe with grateful hearts, learning with joy...not sadness or side-eye...about their OG ancestors.
[Jacob 4:4] Straight up, we wrote this so y'all know we were woke about Christ way before he showed up...had mad hope for his glory hundreds of years back...and it wasn't just us; all the OG prophets were on that same wave too.
[Jacob 4:5] Check it, they believed in Christ and flexed worship to the Father in his name, same as us. That's why we stick to Moses' law...it points straight to Him and makes us clean, just like Abraham's obedient vibe in the wilderness offering Isaac, a low-key symbol of God and His Only Begotten Son.
[Jacob 4:6] So yeah, we dive deep into the prophets and scoop plenty of revelations and prophecy vibes; stacking these receipts gives us solid hope and unshakable faith...real talk, we can even boss up in Jesus' name, making trees, mountains, and waves move like we're running the show.
[Jacob 4:7] But real talk, God flexes our weaknesses so we get that it's only by His grace and big-time mercy on us humans that we even have the power to pull off these moves.
[Jacob 4:8] Yo, God's works are mad epic and mysterious AF; no human can fully decode His moves unless He drops the tea Himself...so fam, don't ever diss His revelations, they're straight fire.
[Jacob 4:9] Peep this: God spoke, and boom...earth showed up; He spoke again, and man popped on the scene. So if God can make all that happen with just words, why wouldn't He be able to boss around the earth and everything He crafted whenever He wants?
[Jacob 4:10] So fam, don't try to school God, just take the advice straight from Him...cause you know He's got that wisdom, justice, and mad mercy on lock over everything He's made.
[Jacob 4:11] So squad, link up with God through Christ's atonement...His Only Begotten Son...and you'll score resurrection power like Christ's, showing up as His first-fruits with solid faith and hyped hope for glory even before He drops in the flesh.
[Jacob 4:12] Yo fam, don't act surprised I'm dropping this knowledge...why wouldn't we talk about Christ's atonement and level up to perfect understanding of Him, just like getting the 411 on resurrection and the after-party world?
[Jacob 4:13] Listen up, if someone's flexing prophecy, it's gotta vibe with real human understanding; the Spirit never cap...speaks only truth about what is and what's coming. These truths hit us clear for saving our souls, and we're not the only ones seeing receipts...God dropped these facts to OG prophets too.
[Jacob 4:14] Real talk, the Jews were mad stubborn, dissing straight-up truth, killing prophets, and chasing stuff way over their heads. So God pulled back the clarity, gave them a bunch of hard-to-get mysteries since they asked for it...and yeah, He did that low-key to make them trip and stumble.
[Jacob 4:15] So here I am, Jacob, vibing with the Spirit to prophesy; I peep that because the Jews stumble, they'll ghost the stone they could've built on for a solid foundation, straight up missing the L/W.
[Jacob 4:16] But check the scriptures: this stone's gonna glow up as the ultimate, final, and only legit foundation the Jews can build on...no cap.
[Jacob 4:17] Yo fam, how TF can they bounce back and build on that solid foundation after ghosting it, so it ends up as their main corner stone? Say less, it's sus.
[Jacob 4:18] Alright squad, I'm 'bout to spill this mystery...unless my Spirit vibes get shook or I trip 'cause I'm stressing way too hard over y'all.
[Jacob 5:1] Yo fam, don't forget the prophet Zenos's words to Israel...like, did you even read that fire?
[Jacob 5:2] Listen up, house of Israel, and catch these words straight from me, a prophet repping the Lord.
[Jacob 5:3] So check it, the Lord's saying He's gonna compare you, house of Israel, to a chill olive tree a dude cared for in his vineyard...but it aged and started to rot.
[Jacob 5:4] So the vineyard boss peeped his olive tree was falling apart, and was like, I'mma prune, dig, and feed it so it can flex young branches and not die on me.
[Jacob 5:5] For real, he did the whole vibe...pruned, dug around, and fed it just like he said he would, no cap.
[Jacob 5:6] After a minute, the tree flexed a few young, soft branches, but peep this...the main top started straight-up dying.
[Jacob 5:7] The vineyard boss saw this and told his servant, "Bruh, losing this tree hits different; snatch some branches from a wild olive tree and bring 'em here...we'll chop off the dying main branches and toss 'em in the fire, no mercy."
[Jacob 5:8] The Lord of the vineyard says, "I'm snatching up these young branches and grafting them wherever I want; even if the root dies, I'll keep the fruit for myself...bet, I'm moving these shoots wherever I please."
[Jacob 5:9] Grab those wild olive branches and plug 'em in to replace the old ones; the ones I pulled off? They're finna get roasted so they don't clog up my vineyard's flex.
[Jacob 5:10] So the Lord's servant played by the book and plugged in those wild olive branches like commanded, no cap.
[Jacob 5:11] The vineyard boss had it dug, pruned, and fed, telling his servant, "Losing this tree hits me hard, so I did this to save the roots from dying...gotta keep 'em for myself, no cap."
[Jacob 5:12] So, go on, keep an eye on the tree and feed it just like I told you...don't slack.
[Jacob 5:13] I'm dropping these down in the lowest spot of my vineyard wherever I want...your opinion ain't needed...'cause I'm tryna save the OG branches and stash the fruit for later; losing this tree and its fruit? That's straight-up sus to me.
[Jacob 5:14] The vineyard Lord bounced and stashed the OG branches of the tame olive tree in the lowest spots of the vineyard, spreading them out based on his vibe and mood.
[Jacob 5:15] After a hot minute, the vineyard Lord told his servant, "Yo, let's roll down and grind in the vineyard together."
[Jacob 5:16] So the vineyard Lord and his servant went down to work, and the servant was like, "Yo boss, peep this...check out the tree."
[Jacob 5:17] The vineyard Lord scoped the tree where wild olive branches got grafted, and it popped off with fruit...looking solid, and the fruit was straight-up like the OG kind.
[Jacob 5:18] The Lord told his servant, "Look, those wild branches soaked up the root's juice, giving mad strength, so they're dropping tame fruit now. Without grafting these branches, the tree would've been dead. Now, I'm banking hella fruit from this tree to stash for later...mine, no cap."
[Jacob 5:19] The vineyard Lord said to his servant, "Let's slide down to the lowest part and see if the OG branches popped off with fruit too, so I can stash that for the season, all for me."
[Jacob 5:20] They went where the master hid the OG branches, and he was like, "Check these out," noticing the first had mad good fruit. Then he told his servant, "Grab that fruit and stash it for the season...been feeding it long time, and it's producing big time for me."
[Jacob 5:21] The servant said to his boss, "Yo, why'd you plant this tree or branch here? This spot's lowkey the worst in your whole vineyard."
[Jacob 5:22] The vineyard Lord clapped back, "Don't try to boss me, I knew this spot was trash, but I told you I've been feeding it all this time and look...it's still pumping out mad fruit."
[Jacob 5:23] The vineyard Lord told his servant, "Peep this, I planted another branch in an even worse spot than before, but I've been feeding it, and it's still flexing with tons of fruit. So, scoop it up and stash it for the season, all for me."
[Jacob 5:24] The vineyard Lord hit his servant with, "Check this branch I planted too...I fed it good, and it's born fruit just like the rest."
[Jacob 5:25] Then the Lord told his servant, "Scope this last one I planted in a prime spot...been feeding it long, but only half the tree's dropping chill fruit while the rest stays wild; still, I cared for it just like the others."
[Jacob 5:26] The vineyard Lord told his servant straight up, "Snip off the deadbeat branches that didn't produce good fruit and toss 'em into the fire."
[Jacob 5:27] The servant was like, "Hold up, let's trim and dig around it, feed it a bit more...maybe it'll turn up some good fruit you can stash for the season."
[Jacob 5:28] So, the vineyard Lord and his servant went all in, feeding and caring for every fruit in the vineyard, no cap.
[Jacob 5:29] After a long grind, the vineyard Lord told his servant, "Let's dip into the vineyard and hustle again...time's almost up, and the end's coming, so I gotta stash fruit for the season, all for me."
[Jacob 5:30] The vineyard Lord and his servant rolled down to the vineyard and found the tree where the OG branches got snapped and wild ones got grafted in, and low-key, the tree was flexing with all kinds of fruit.
[Jacob 5:31] The vineyard Lord sampled every type of fruit by the squad, then said, "We've been feeding this tree mad long, and I've stacked up plenty fruit for the season, no cap."
[Jacob 5:32] But real talk, this time it dropped a ton of fruit, and none of it's good...just straight bad vibes everywhere. All that grind was for nothing, and honestly, it hits me hard thinking I might lose this tree.
[Jacob 5:33] The vineyard Lord asked his servant, "What's the move to save this tree and get that good fruit back for me?"
[Jacob 5:34] The servant told his boss, "Look, since you grafted in the wild olive branches, they fed the roots and kept 'em alive, so the roots are still solid."
[Jacob 5:35] The vineyard Lord was like, "The tree and its roots don't do me any favors if all they're pumping out is trash fruit."
[Jacob 5:36] Still, I know the roots are solid, and I kept them on deck for my own reasons; their strength has pulled through so far, bringing decent fruit from those wild branches.
[Jacob 5:37] But low-key, those wild branches took over the roots, and 'cause of that, the tree's been dropping mad bad fruit; it's starting to die, and soon it'll be toast...unless we do something to save it.
[Jacob 5:38] The vineyard Lord told his servant, "Let's slide down to the lowest spot in the vineyard and check if the OG branches also spit out bad fruit."
[Jacob 5:39] So they dipped to the bottom of the vineyard and saw that even the OG branches' fruit was sus...first, second, and last...all gone corrupt.
[Jacob 5:40] The wild fruit from the end totally took over the good fruit spot, making that branch straight-up wither and die.
[Jacob 5:41] The vineyard Lord low-key broke down and asked his servant, "What else could I have done for my vineyard?"
[Jacob 5:42] Look, I already knew all the vineyard's fruit except these were corrupted, but now even those good ones turned bad; honestly, every tree here's just waiting to be chopped and tossed into the flames.
[Jacob 5:43] And check this...this last branch that died? I planted it in the prime spot, like the best patch in my whole vineyard, no cap.
[Jacob 5:44] You saw I even chopped down the junk cluttering that spot so I could plant this tree right there.
[Jacob 5:45] You saw some parts gave good fruit, some went wild, and since I didn't yank out the bad branches and toss them into the fire, they took over, making the good branch wither.
[Jacob 5:46] So, even with all the hustle we put into my vineyard, the trees went corrupt and ain't dropping any good fruit; I wanted to save them for my own stash, but now they're just wild olives, worthless except for chopping and burning...and it's low-key breaking my heart to lose them.
[Jacob 5:47] But fr, what else could I have done for my vineyard? Did I slack off and not feed it? Nah, I fed it, dug around, pruned, fertilized, and worked it all day...now the end's close, and it sucks I gotta chop down all these trees and burn 'em. Who's the real one messing up my vineyard?
[Jacob 5:48] Then the servant hit up his boss like, "Isn't it 'cause your vineyard's branches got all high and mighty, overpowering the solid roots? Since the branches flexed harder than the roots could handle, they snatched the strength for themselves. Bet that's why your vineyard's trees went corrupt."
[Jacob 5:49] The vineyard Lord told his servant, "Let's just chop down these trees and toss 'em in the fire so they don't block my vineyard...I've done everything I could. What else was left for me to do?"
[Jacob 5:50] But the servant was like, "Hold up, boss, let's give it a little more time, chill."
[Jacob 5:51] The Lord replied, "Bet, I'll give it some more time, 'cause losing my vineyard trees low-key hurts me."
[Jacob 5:52] So, let's snatch branches from the deepest parts of my vineyard, graft them back onto their OG tree, and yank the branches with the nastiest fruit to swap in some real ones instead.
[Jacob 5:53] I'm doing this so the tree won't die, hoping to save the roots for my own goals, no cap.
[Jacob 5:54] Look, the roots of the original branches I planted wherever I wanted are still alive; so to keep them safe for my plans, I'll take branches from this tree and graft them in, even from their mother tree, hoping that once they're strong enough, they'll drop good fruit and I can flex on the glory of my vineyard's harvest.
[Jacob 5:55] So they grabbed branches from the OG tree that went wild and grafted them onto the natural trees that also turned wild.
[Jacob 5:56] They also snatched branches from the wild natural trees and grafted them back into their mother tree.
[Jacob 5:57] The Lord of the vineyard told his servant, "Don't yank the wild branches unless they're straight-up bitter; then graft based on what I said, say less."
[Jacob 5:58] We'll feed the vineyard trees again, trim their branches, and snatch the ripe ones that gotta go, tossing them into the fire...no cap.
[Jacob 5:59] The move is to maybe pump up the roots with goodness and swap the branches so the good vibes clout over the bad.
[Jacob 5:60] Since I've kept the OG branches and roots alive, grafted them back to the mother tree, and saved those roots too, maybe the vineyard will flex good fruit again, and I'll hype up the joy of preserving the first fruit's roots and branches, no cap.
[Jacob 5:61] So, squad up and call the servants...time to grind hard in the vineyard, prepping the scene so I can bring back that natural fruit, the real MVP, top-tier above all else.
[Jacob 5:62] Bet, let's hustle hard this final round 'cause the end's pulling up, and this is my last time trimming the vineyard.
[Jacob 5:63] Graft those branches starting with the last so they can glow up first and the first go low-key last; dig around all trees...old and young, first and last...making sure everyone's fed one last time.
[Jacob 5:64] So dig, prune, and fertilize them one more time...last chance, 'cause the end's close. If these final grafts pop off and drop natural fruit, then get ready to let them grow.
[Jacob 5:65] When those grafts start growing, cut off branches with bitter fruit based on how strong and big the good is; don't yank all the bad at once or the roots will flex too hard and kill the graft...I ain't tryna lose my vineyard trees, no cap.
[Jacob 5:66] It lowkey hurts to lose my vineyard trees, so y'all gotta clear bad branches as the good grows, keeping roots and tops balanced until good flexes over bad, then chop the bad down and burn 'em so the vineyard stays clean...I'll wipe out the bad for real.
[Jacob 5:67] I'm gonna graft the natural tree's branches back into the natural tree, no cap.
[Jacob 5:68] I'll graft the natural tree's branches into its natural branches, bringing them back as one so they can drop that natural fruit, say less.
[Jacob 5:69] The bad's getting yeeted straight outta my vineyard land, no cap...this is my one and only prune sesh.
[Jacob 5:70] So the Lord of the vineyard sent his servant, who rolled out, did the boss's bidding, and brought some other servants...low-key squad was small.
[Jacob 5:71] The Lord said, "Bet, grind hard in the vineyard now...last chance to nourish it 'cause the end's legit close and the season's coming fast; work with me and you'll flex joy from the fruit I'm saving up for the near future."
[Jacob 5:72] So the servants went all in, grinding hard; the Lord of the vineyard was in the mix too, and they obeyed His commands no cap, no cap.
[Jacob 5:73] Natural fruit started popping up again, natural branches thrived big time; wild branches got plucked and tossed, and they kept roots and tops balanced based on their strength...no sus moves.
[Jacob 5:74] They hustled hard, following the Lord's commands till all the bad got yeeted out, and the trees flexed natural fruit again, vibing as one body with equal fruit...Lord kept that OG precious fruit safe from day one.
[Jacob 5:75] When the Lord peeped his fruit was straight fire and the vineyard wasn't sus anymore, he hit up his servants like, "This last nourish sesh went how I wanted...natural fruit saved, OG vibes intact. Big ups to y'all for grinding with me, keeping the commandments, and bringing back the real fruit; now the vineyard's clean and the bad's ghosted. Get ready to flex joy with me over this fruit."
[Jacob 5:76] Yo, I'm gonna stash my vineyard's fruit for hella long till that fast-approaching season; this last nourish, prune, dig, and dung was it...so I'm hoarding the fruit for myself like I said, no cap.
[Jacob 5:77] When evil fruit slides back into my vineyard, I'll gather the good and bad; keep the good for myself and yeet the bad to its own spot. Then the season drops...the endgame...and I'm burning that vineyard down with fire, no cap.
[Jacob 6:1] So fam, like I said I'd drop prophecy, here it is: the stuff prophet Zenos said about Israel being like a chill olive tree? Yeah, that's gonna go down for real, no cap.
[Jacob 6:2] When the Lord puts in work again to snap back His people...the final round...that's when His servants roll out with full power to nourish and prune the vineyard; after that, the end's coming quick.
[Jacob 6:3] Mad blessed are those grinding hard in His vineyard; but cursed are the ones getting yeeted to their own spot. Heads up...the whole world's finna get roasted with fire.
[Jacob 6:4] God's mad merciful, always remembering Israel's roots and branches, reaching out all day; they're stubborn and always capping, but anyone who don't harden their heart? Say less...they're saved in God's kingdom.
[Jacob 6:5] So, my beloved fam, for real I'm asking y'all soberly: repent, come through with full vibes, stick to God like He's stuck to you. While His mercy arm's out during the day, don't go hardening your hearts, bet?
[Jacob 6:6] Yo, today's the move ... if you hear His voice, don't go stiffen your heart; fr, why you wanna catch that L and die?
[Jacob 6:7] After soaking up God's good word all day, you really gonna flex bad fruit and get chopped down and thrown in the fire? That's hella sus.
[Jacob 6:8] So, you really gonna ghost these words? Skip past the prophets, deny all the talks about Christ after so many dropped receipts? Throw shade on Christ's good word, God's power, the Holy Ghost's gifts, kill the Spirit's vibe, and clown the whole redemption plan set up for you? Big sus, no cap.
[Jacob 6:9] Don't you get it? If you play these games, Christ's redemption and resurrection power will have you standing hella embarrassed and guilty at God's judgment, no cap.
[Jacob 6:10] And for real, justice can't be ghosted, so you'll get sent to that endless fire and brimstone lake, flames on full unquenchable mode, smoke rising forever...straight up eternal torment, no cap.
[Jacob 6:11] Yo, beloved fam, repent for real and slide through that tight gate, keep grinding the narrow path until you secure eternal life...no cap.
[Jacob 6:12] Yo, be smart...what else even needs to be said?
[Jacob 6:13] Alright, fam, I'm out for now...catch you at God's righteous bar, where the wicked catch mad fear and dread. Amen.
[Jacob 7:1] So, after a few years, this dude Sherem popped up among the Nephites, no cap.
[Jacob 7:2] Sherem started preaching, telling the people no Christ was coming, dropping mad flattering lines to flex and try to cancel Christ's whole vibe.
[Jacob 7:3] This guy hustled hard to snatch people's hearts and low-key pulled a bunch, and knowing I, Jacob, had mad faith in Christ, he was all about catching me one-on-one.
[Jacob 7:4] He was hella schooled, spoke the people's language fluently, so he flexed crazy flattery and slick talk powered straight from the devil's playbook.
[Jacob 7:5] Dude thought he could shake my faith, but nah...I got mad revelations, seen angels IRL, and heard God's voice drop real talk on me often, so I stayed unshakable.
[Jacob 7:6] So he rolls up to me like, "Yo Brother Jacob, I've been lowkey hunting for a chance to talk since I heard you're out there preaching that gospel, that Christ doctrine vibe."
[Jacob 7:7] He clapped back, "You got people twisted, ditching God's true way and law of Moses to worship some future dude you say's dropping centuries later. Sherem here calls that blasphemy...nobody knows the future. That's how he threw shade at me."
[Jacob 7:8] But fr, God poured His Spirit into me so hard I totally clapped back and shut down all his weak arguments.
[Jacob 7:9] I asked him straight up, "You really denying the Christ who's comin'?" He was like, "If there was a Christ, I wouldn't deny, but I know there ain't been one, nor will there ever be."
[Jacob 7:10] I hit him with, "You actually believe the scriptures?" He goes, "Yeah, I do."
[Jacob 7:11] I told him, "Then you're missing the plot...scriptures are straight-up shouting Christ. No prophet wrote or prophesied without dropping bars about Him."
[Jacob 7:12] And that's not even the tea...God made it clear to me through visions, hearsay, and that Holy Ghost flex; no atonement means all humans are straight-up doomed, no cap.
[Jacob 7:13] Then he was like, "Yo, flex a sign from that Holy Ghost power you're always talking about, prove your receipts."
[Jacob 7:14] I said, "Why would I test God by showing you a sign you already know is real? You'll still deny it 'cause you're vibing with the devil. Either way, not my will...if God smacks you down, that's your sign He runs heaven and earth and that Christ's coming. Lord's will, not mine, bet."
[Jacob 7:15] So after I dropped that speech, God's power hit him so hard he crashed to the ground, and then he was kept alive for mad days after.
[Jacob 7:16] Then he told the crowd, "Pull up tomorrow 'cause I'm about to dip for good and wanna drop some last words before I ghost."
[Jacob 7:17] Next day the squad rolled up, and he came clean...dissed all his old lies, copped to Christ, the Holy Ghost's power, and angels showing up IRL.
[Jacob 7:18] He kept it 100, admitting the devil had him played, then dropped facts about hell, eternity, and real-deal eternal punishment.
[Jacob 7:19] He said, "Low-key scared I pulled the unpardonable sin by lying to God...denying Christ while saying I believed the scriptures that straight-up flex on Him. 'Cause of that lie, I'm shook my fate's messed up, but I'm confessing to God anyway."
[Jacob 7:20] After he dropped those bars, he ran out of words and then straight up gave up the ghost.
[Jacob 7:21] When the crew saw him spill the truth right before he dipped for good, they were shook AF, and God's power slammed down on them so hard they all crashed to the ground.
[Jacob 7:22] TBH, I, Jacob, was low-key vibing with this 'cause I asked my Heavenly Father for it, and He heard my DM and hit me back with an answer.
[Jacob 7:23] Peace and God's love were back on deck with the people; they dove into the scriptures and ghosted all the sus words of that wicked dude.
[Jacob 7:24] Lots of tries went down to reel the Lamanites back to truth, but nah...it was all a blank 'cause they were all about war and drama, holding mad hate against us, their own fam, and kept trying to clap us with their weapons nonstop.
[Jacob 7:25] So the Nephi crew beefed up defenses, flexing mad strength and weapons, putting full trust in God...their solid rock...and ended up snatching W's over their haters.
[Jacob 7:26] So yeah, I, Jacob, started getting old; since the rest is on Nephi's plates, I'm wrapping this up, saying I wrote straight-up with the best I got...life flew by like a dream for us lonely, serious wanderers, bounced from Jerusalem, born into struggle in the wild, hated by our own people, sparking wars and beef, so we spent our days mourning the whole vibe.
[Jacob 7:27] I, Jacob, peeped my grave was near, so I told my son Enos, "Take these plates," shared Nephi's orders, and he promised to stay loyal. That's a wrap on my lowkey short writing; to whoever's reading, peace out...I hope my fam really vibes with these words. Brethren, adieu.
[Enos 1:1] Yo, it went down that I, Enos, knew my dad was righteous...he schooled me in his own words and schooled me hard in the Lord's ways...mad respect to God for that.
[Enos 1:2] Let me spill the tea on the mad spiritual wrestle I went through with God before He wiped my slate clean.
[Enos 1:3] So I was out hunting wild stuff in the woods when my dad's talks about eternal life and saintly vibes hit me right in the feels.
[Enos 1:4] My soul was straight-up starving, so I dropped to my knees before my Maker, praying hard all day and into the night, yelling so loud the heavens had to hear me.
[Enos 1:5] Then this voice hit me up like, "Enos, you're forgiven, and mad blessings coming your way."
[Enos 1:6] I, Enos, knew God's no cap and never lies, so all my guilt just got wiped clean.
[Enos 1:7] I was like, "Lord, how you pull that off?"
[Enos 1:8] He hit me back, "It's 'cause you vibed with faith in Christ, even tho you never saw or heard Him yet. Years ahead before He shows up in the flesh, so yeah, your faith just made you whole."
[Enos 1:9] After hearing that, I caught mad feels for my Nephite fam and straight-up poured my whole soul out to God for their good.
[Enos 1:10] While I was deep in spiritual hustle, the Lord's voice popped into my mind again, saying, "I'll check on your peeps based on how they keep my rules. This land's holy, given to them, but if they mess up, I'll curse it...and their sins will straight-up land back on them with mad sorrow."
[Enos 1:11] After hearing that, my faith in the Lord went full unshakeable, and I prayed hard, grinding long fights for my Lamanite fam.
[Enos 1:12] After I prayed and hustled nonstop, the Lord said, "Bet, I'll hook you up with what you want 'cause your faith is solid."
[Enos 1:13] So here's what I asked for...if my Nephite squad falls into sin and gets wrecked but the Lamanites survive, I begged God to keep a record of us, so someday it could drop to the Lamanites and maybe save them.
[Enos 1:14] Right now, our efforts to bring them back to the real faith were straight-up L; they were so mad they swore they'd wipe out our records, us, and all our OG traditions if they could.
[Enos 1:15] So, knowing God could keep our records safe, I kept crying out nonstop, 'cause He said, "Ask in faith, believe you'll get it in Christ's name, and it's yours."
[Enos 1:16] I had faith and straight-up begged God to keep the records safe; He promised me He'd drop them to the Lamanites when the time's right.
[Enos 1:17] I, Enos, low-key knew God would come through on His promise, so my soul chilled out for real.
[Enos 1:18] The Lord told me, "Your ancestors asked the same, and I'll deliver based on their faith, 'cause their faith was just like yours...solid as hell."
[Enos 1:19] So, I, Enos, went around the Nephites flexing prophecy skills and dropping receipts about what I'd heard and seen.
[Enos 1:20] I keep it 100...Nephites tried hard to bring Lamanites back to true faith, but it was a lost cause; their hate was set, they went savage, full-on wild with mad idolatry, living rough in tents, rocking short skin belts and shaved heads, expert with bow, sword, and axe, often eating raw meat, always plotting to take us down.
[Enos 1:21] The Nephites flexed by farming the land, growing all kinds of grains and fruits, and raising herds of cattle, goats...wild and chill...and tons of horses too.
[Enos 1:22] We had mad prophets all around, but the people? Total stubborn vibes...hard to read and even harder to deal with.
[Enos 1:23] It was all tough talk...preaching nonstop about wars, beefs, destruction, death, eternity, God's power...basically spamming that fear of the Lord to keep them from tanking fast. No sugarcoating; only straight fire kept them from nosediving. That's how I write it.
[Enos 1:24] During my time, I straight-up witnessed beefs and wars popping off between the Nephites and Lamanites.
[Enos 1:25] So, I started getting old, and 179 years had clocked since our dad Lehi bounced from Jerusalem.
[Enos 1:26] I peeped that my time to dip to the grave was near, 'cause God's power had me locked in to preach and prophecy the real word about Christ. I've been on that grind all my days, vibing way harder with it than anything this world throws.
[Enos 1:27] I'm about to hit my rest spot with my Redeemer, no cap, 'cause I know peace is locked in with Him. Can't wait for the day I switch this mortal for immortality and flex before Him, when He'll say, "Come thru, blessed ones, I got a room saved for you in my Father's crib." Amen.
[Jarom 1:1] Yo, I'm Jarom, dropping a few lines 'cause my dad Enos told me to, so our family history stays locked and loaded.
[Jarom 1:2] These plates are tiny, and since I'm writing mainly to help our Lamanite fam, I gotta keep it short; I'm not throwing down my own prophecies or visions...like, what more can I add than the old heads already dropped? They already laid out salvation's blueprint, and honestly, that's enough for me.
[Jarom 1:3] Real talk, a lot needs to happen with these people 'cause their hearts are stone, ears blocked, minds straight-up blind, and necks mad stiff; yet God's mad merciful and hasn't wiped them out yet.
[Jarom 1:4] Plenty of us catch mad revelations 'cause not everyone's stiffnecked; those who got faith link up with the Holy Spirit, which flexes truth to everyone based on their vibe.
[Jarom 1:5] Fast forward 200 years, and the Nephites were straight-up thriving, sticking to Moses' law and keeping the Sabbath holy...no cap on respect, no blasphemy, and the rules were hella strict.
[Jarom 1:6] The Nephites and Lamanites were all over the place, but the Lamanites were way more numerous, low-key savage, loving murder and even sipping beast blood like it's some wild ritual.
[Jarom 1:7] The Lamanites kept trying to throw hands at us Nephites, but our kings and leaders were straight-up beasts in the Lord's faith, schooling the people in His ways; so we held them off, pushed them out, and started beefing up our cities and lands.
[Jarom 1:8] We blew up in numbers and spread wide, stacking mad gold, silver, and fancy stuff, flexing with top-tier woodwork, buildings, machines, plus iron, copper, brass, and steel...crafting every tool to farm and weapons for war, from sharp arrows and quivers to darts and javelins, fully strapped for battle.
[Jarom 1:9] So, we prepped to face the Lamanites, and they couldn't flex on us; the Lord's word to our ancestors held up: stay obedient, and you'll thrive in the land...straight facts, no cap.
[Jarom 1:10] The Lord's prophets warned the Nephites straight up: break the commandments and slide into sin, and you'll get wiped from the face of the land, no receipts needed.
[Jarom 1:11] So the prophets, priests, and teachers grinded hard, patiently pushing the people to stay woke, schooling them on Moses' law and why it dropped, hyping them to keep their eyes on the Messiah like He's already here...straight up teaching with that energy.
[Jarom 1:12] By doing this, they kept the people from getting wiped out; the word hit their hearts hard, constantly poking them to repent and get right.
[Jarom 1:13] So, 238 years rolled by, mostly filled with wars, beefs, and drama dragging on for way too long.
[Jarom 1:14] Yo, I'm Jarom, and I'm done here...plates are tiny. But fr, fam, check the other Nephi plates for the full receipts on our wars, penned by kings or their scribes.
[Jarom 1:15] I'm handing these plates over to my son Omni, making sure they're kept tight, all according to our dads' commandments...say less.
[Omni 1:1] So check it, I'm Omni, and my dad Jarom told me to jot down some stuff on these plates to keep our family history lit and saved.
[Omni 1:2] Low-key, I, Omni, was swinging swords heavy to keep the Nephites safe from the Lamanites, but real talk, I'm kinda sus...didn't keep the Lord's rules like I should've, no cap.
[Omni 1:3] So, 276 years zoomed by with waves of peace and straight-up savage wars, and by year 282, I kept these plates as my dads said, then handed them to my son Amaron...I'm out.
[Omni 1:4] Yo, I'm Amaron, dropping just a few lines in my dad's book...keeping it short and sweet.
[Omni 1:5] By year 320, the Nephites' most sus crew got straight-up destroyed...bad vibes only.
[Omni 1:6] God wasn't about to let things slide...after saving them from Jerusalem and enemies, He made sure His words to our ancestors stayed 100: if you don't keep His commandments, no glow-up for you in this land.
[Omni 1:7] So God hit them with major judgment, but low-key spared the righteous squad, pulling them out from enemy clutches...big save energy.
[Omni 1:8] I passed these plates over to my bro Chemish...keeping the legacy moving, no cap.
[Omni 1:9] Yo, I'm Chemish, dropping a few lines in my bro's book 'cause I saw him write it himself when he handed me the plates...keeping records as our dads told us, say less, I'm done.
[Omni 1:10] Yo, I'm Abinadom, Chemish's son. I witnessed mad war and beef between the Nephites and Lamanites, and I personally clapped a bunch of Lamanites to protect my squad.
[Omni 1:11] Facts: the kings keep these plates with the people's history by generation, and I got no extra revelations or prophecies...just what's already written, so that's enough. I'm out.
[Omni 1:12] Yo, Amaleki here, Abinadom's son. Let me spill on King Mosiah, who got the crown over Zarahemla...God told him to dip from Nephi, and anyone vibing with God's call bounced with him into the wild.
[Omni 1:13] So Mosiah flexed obedience, dipped with all who heard God's voice, riding the wave of preachings and prophecies, getting constant God checks, and got led through the wilderness by His power till they landed in Zarahemla.
[Omni 1:14] They found this crew called the people of Zarahemla, and everyone was hyped, especially Zarahemla himself, 'cause God sent Mosiah's squad with the brass plates holding the Jewish receipts.
[Omni 1:15] So Mosiah found out the Zarahemla peeps bounced from Jerusalem right when King Zedekiah got snatched and dragged off to Babylon...big history receipts.
[Omni 1:16] They trekked the wilderness, guided by God's hand, crossed mad big waters, and landed where Mosiah found them...and they've been living there ever since, no cap.
[Omni 1:17] When Mosiah found 'em, they were mad numerous but had been caught up in wars and beefs, taking L's in battle, their language got sus and corrupted, no records on deck, and they straight-up denied their Creator; Mosiah and his crew couldn't even vibe with their talk.
[Omni 1:18] Mosiah made sure they learned his language, and after leveling up, Zarahemla dropped the family tree from memory...written down, but not on these plates, just sayin'.
[Omni 1:19] The Zarahemla squad and Mosiah's crew linked up, and Mosiah got crowned king...main character energy unlocked.
[Omni 1:20] During Mosiah's reign, someone rolled up with a big engraved stone, and Mosiah decoded the script straight-up powered by God's plug...no cap.
[Omni 1:21] They spilled the tea on Coriantumr and his fallen crew, and the Zarahemla peeps found Coriantumr, who stayed with them for nine whole moons...real long-term vibes.
[Omni 1:22] The stone also dropped some words about his ancestors who dipped from the tower when God scrambled languages; God's justice hit hard, and their bones got scattered up north...facts only.
[Omni 1:23] Yo, I'm Amaleki, born during Mosiah's days, caught his final scene, and now his son Benjamin's running the show...pass the crown, no cap.
[Omni 1:24] So, in King Benjamin's time, there was mad war and blood between Nephites and Lamanites, but the Nephites flexed hard, and Benjamin straight-up bounced them from Zarahemla's turf.
[Omni 1:25] I'm gettin' old, no heirs, and since King Benjamin's a straight-up righteous dude, I'm passing him these plates, telling everyone to come thru to God...the Holy One of Israel...and trust in prophecy, revelations, angel hookups, speaking in tongues, language skills, and all things good...'cause all good stuff is from God, and evil? That's pure devil energy.
[Omni 1:26] Yo fam, come thru to Christ, the Holy One of Israel, tap into his salvation and redemption power. Bring your full soul as an offering, keep fasting and praying, grind it out till the end, and no cap, as the Lord lives, you'll be saved.
[Omni 1:27] Low-key gotta mention some peeps who dipped into the wilderness aiming to bounce back to Nephi's land 'cause they were hyped to claim their family's turf.
[Omni 1:28] So they bounced into the wilderness, but their captain was hella stubborn and started beef, ending with all but fifty dead; the survivors dipped back to Zarahemla's hood.
[Omni 1:29] Then they recruited more folks, rolling deep this time, and hit the wilderness trail again...round two, no cap.
[Omni 1:30] I'm Amaleki, and my brother rolled with those peeps, but since then, he straight-up ghosted; I'm about to kick the bucket, plates packed, and that's my final flex.
[Words of Mormon 1:1] Yo, I'm Mormon, about to hand my record over to my son Moroni, and low-key, I've seen almost all my Nephite squad get wrecked...straight-up devastation.
[Words of Mormon 1:2] So it's been centuries after Christ showed up when I drop these records to my son, expecting he'll see my people totally wiped out; pray God he survives to flex some wisdom about them and Christ, so maybe someday it helps someone...say less.
[Words of Mormon 1:3] So, after I clipped down the Nephi plates up to King Benjamin's reign (shoutout to Amaleki), I dug through the records I got and found these plates with a brief rundown of the prophets...from Jacob to King Benjamin...and plenty of Nephi's own words too.
[Words of Mormon 1:4] These plates hit different 'cause they drop prophecies about Christ's arrival; my ancestors saw some come true, and I know the ones done so far are receipts, with more for the future guaranteed to drop.
[Words of Mormon 1:5] So I picked these to wrap up my record, grabbing the rest from Nephi's plates, 'cause honestly, I couldn't even write a hundredth of my people's whole story...straight up too much tea.
[Words of Mormon 1:6] Bet, I'm gonna stash these plates with the rest of my record 'cause these prophecies and revelations are straight fire to me, and I know my peeps will vibe with them too.
[Words of Mormon 1:7] I'm doing this for a low-key smart reason, 'cause the Spirit of the Lord's whispering in my ear; I don't have all the tea, but God's got the full receipts and is moving me to follow His vibe.
[Words of Mormon 1:8] I'm praying God hooks up my crew with that glow-up...getting back woke on Him and Christ's redemption so they can flex as a vibesome people again.
[Words of Mormon 1:9] So yeah, I'm Mormon, finishing up my record pulled from Nephi's plates, writing it straight from the wisdom God's plugged me with...no cap.
[Words of Mormon 1:10] So when Amaleki handed these plates over to King Benjamin, the king just stacked them with the other royal records passed down through the generations, all the way to his own era.
[Words of Mormon 1:11] These records passed down from King Benjamin through the years till they landed with me, Mormon; I'm praying God keeps them safe 'cause they hold big receipts that will judge my people and their fam on Judgment Day, straight from His word.
[Words of Mormon 1:12] Now, about King Benjamin...his squad was kinda sus, dealing with beef and drama within their own crew.
[Words of Mormon 1:13] So the Lamanite armies rolled up from Nephi ready to throw hands at King Benjamin's crew, but he flexed hard, squad assembled, and fought back wielding Laban's sword like a total boss.
[Words of Mormon 1:14] Powered by the Lord's strength, they went hard on their enemies, slaying thousands of Lamanites, pushing them straight outta all their inherited lands...no cap, total domination.
[Words of Mormon 1:15] So after some fake Christs got exposed, had their rizz shut down, and got dealt with justice-style for their sketch moves;
[Words of Mormon 1:16] After fake prophets, preachers, and teachers got called out and owned for their sus deeds, and mad beef spilled over to the Lamanites, King Benjamin rolled up with his holy prophet squad to handle biz...say less.
[Words of Mormon 1:17] King Benjamin was straight-up holy and ruled his squad with mad righteousness; plenty of other holy homies were dropping God's word hard and with clout, throwing shade 'cause the people stayed stubborn as hell.
[Words of Mormon 1:18] So with these holy homies backing him, King Benjamin grinded hard...body and soul...plus the prophets, and they flexed peace vibes all over the land again.
[Mosiah 1:1] No more beef in Zarahemla among King Benjamin's crew, so dude enjoyed chill, nonstop peace for the rest of his days...big W energy.
[Mosiah 1:2] King Benjamin had three sons...Mosiah, Helorum, and Helaman...and made sure they got schooled in all their ancestors' languages, so they'd glow up with mad understanding and peep the prophecies dropped by their forefathers straight from God's hand.
[Mosiah 1:3] He schooled them on the brass plates engraved with records, saying, "Yo sons, without these plates holding commandments and knowledge, we'd be stuck dumb right now, clueless about God's mysteries...no cap."
[Mosiah 1:4] No way our dad Lehi could've remembered all this to teach his kids without these plates; since he knew Egyptian, he read the engravings and passed the knowledge down, so the fam stayed woke and kept God's commands real until now.
[Mosiah 1:5] Listen up, sons...if it weren't for these God-preserved records letting us read and get His mysteries plus keep His commandments front and center, even our dads would've dipped into unbelief, and we'd be living like the Lamanites, clueless or straight-up ignoring the truth thanks to their sus traditions.
[Mosiah 1:6] Yo sons, remember these words and records are 100% real; plus, the plates of Nephi hold our ancestors' records from when they dipped Jerusalem till now, and we know they're legit 'cause we got them right in front of us.
[Mosiah 1:7] So, sons, make sure y'all grind hard searching these records to level up, and keep God's commandments to flex blessings and glow up in the land like the Lord promised our forefathers.
[Mosiah 1:8] King Benjamin schooled his sons on mad stuff that didn't even make it into this book...low-key exclusive knowledge.
[Mosiah 1:9] After King Benjamin finished his lessons, he got old and realized his time was short, so he decided it was smart to hand over the kingdom to one of his sons...say less.
[Mosiah 1:10] So King Benjamin called Mosiah and told him, "Bruh, blast a proclamation all over Zarahemla and Mosiah's peeps so they squad up, 'cause tomorrow I'm dropping the news straight: you're the king and ruler God hooked us up with."
[Mosiah 1:11] Plus, I'm gonna give these folks a name that makes them stand out from all the crews God pulled from Jerusalem, 'cause they've been grinding hard keeping the Lord's commandments...big respect, no cap.
[Mosiah 1:12] I'm giving them a name that won't get erased...unless they totally mess up and break the rules.
[Mosiah 1:13] Yo, if God's fav squad slips up, turns wicked, and plays dirty, the Lord'll ditch them, making them weak like their bros, and He won't flex His epic power to protect them like He did our ancestors before.
[Mosiah 1:14] No cap, if God hadn't stepped in big time to save our dads, they'd have been straight-up caught by the Lamanites and got destroyed by their hate.
[Mosiah 1:15] After King Benjamin dropped all these gems to his son, he handed him the full boss control over the kingdom's business...big boss energy activated.
[Mosiah 1:16] Plus, he put Mosiah on guard duty over the brass plates, Nephi's plates, Laban's sword, and the director ball that guided our ancestors through the wild... all God-prepped so they'd get led right if they stayed woke and on their grind.
[Mosiah 1:17] So, since they bounced on faith and went sus, their journey went downhill, God got mad, and they caught famine and serious L's to snap them back to their responsibilities.
[Mosiah 1:18] Mosiah ran with his dad's orders and hyped everyone in Zarahemla to squad up and hit the temple to catch the wisdom his dad was about to drop.
[Mosiah 2:1] After Mosiah flexed his dad's commands and went full announcer across the land, the people rolled up from everywhere to hit the temple and catch King Benjamin's speech.
[Mosiah 2:2] The crowd was mad huge...like uncountable...because they'd blown up big time and were thriving all over the land, no cap.
[Mosiah 2:3] They brought the freshest of their flocks to drop sacrifices and burnt offerings, playing by Moses' rulebook, no cap.
[Mosiah 2:4] They also wanted to thank the Lord who bounced them from Jerusalem, saved them from enemies, set up legit teachers and a king to bring peace in Zarahemla, and schooled them to vibe with God's commandments so they could flex joy and love for God and everyone else.
[Mosiah 2:5] When they rolled up to the temple, each squad set up tents around it...every dude with his whole fam: wife, kids, grandkids, oldest to youngest...all squad goals but keeping their own space.
[Mosiah 2:6] They set up tents all around the temple, each with the door facing it, so everyone could chill inside and catch every word King Benjamin dropped.
[Mosiah 2:7] The crowd was so massive King Benjamin couldn't teach them all inside the temple, so he built a tower to make sure everyone caught his words loud and clear.
[Mosiah 2:8] So he started preaching from the tower, but even then the crowd was too big for everyone to hear, so he made sure his words got written down and sent to those out of earshot, so no one missed the tea.
[Mosiah 2:9] Here's what he said and made sure got written: "Yo fam, if you've rolled up and can hear me, don't come here just to clown on my words...actually listen up, open your ears, hearts, and minds so God's mysteries can get unlocked for you."
[Mosiah 2:10] I didn't tell y'all to come here to be scared of me or to think I'm anything more than just a regular human, no cap.
[Mosiah 2:11] But I'm just like you...got all the same body and mind struggles; still, this squad picked me, my dad set me up for this, and the Lord blessed me to be their king, keeping me powered up so I can serve y'all with everything God's given me.
[Mosiah 2:12] I'm telling y'all, I've been here grinding for you nonstop, never chasing gold, silver, or any rich vibes from you.
[Mosiah 2:13] I haven't let y'all get locked up in dungeons, make slaves outta each other, or slide into murder, theft, plunder, adultery, or any straight-up wicked moves; instead, I've schooled you to stick to God's commandments, no cap.
[Mosiah 2:14] And low-key, I've been grinding with my own hands to serve y'all, so you don't get buried in taxes or any heavy BS...and you're all receipts for that today.
[Mosiah 2:15] Listen, I'm not flexing or trying to throw shade on y'all, I'm just saying this so you know I'm coming clean before God today, no cap.
[Mosiah 2:16] Look, when I say I've spent my days serving you, I'm not flexing...I've really just been out here serving God the whole time, straight up.
[Mosiah 2:17] Real talk: I'm dropping this so you catch some wisdom...serving others is really just serving God, no cap.
[Mosiah 2:18] So y'all called me king, right? If your king's out here hustling to serve you, shouldn't y'all be grinding to serve each other too? Say less.
[Mosiah 2:19] And fr, if your king...me...has been grinding for y'all and God, and deserves some thanks, then you better be going full send thanking your real OG, the heavenly King!
[Mosiah 2:20] Yo fam, if you gave all the thanks and hype your soul can flex to God, who made you, kept you alive, made you happy, and blessed y'all with peace...no cap.
[Mosiah 2:21] Straight up, even if you serve the God who made you and keeps you breathing every second, letting you live your own way, and backin' you nonstop, you're still just unprofitable servants...no receipts for more.
[Mosiah 2:22] Check it, all God wants is for you to keep His commandments, and He promised that if you stay loyal to them, you'll thrive in the land...He's never been sus or switched up on that, so obey and watch the blessings roll in.
[Mosiah 2:23] First off, He made you and gave you life, so you low-key owe Him for that straight-up fact.
[Mosiah 2:24] Second, He's asking you to follow His commands, and if you do, He blesses you instantly...like, He's already paid you back...so you're still in debt to Him forever. So, what's there to flex about?
[Mosiah 2:25] Real talk: can you brag about anything on your own? Nah. You're not even as big a deal as dirt, yet you were made from dirt...so everything still belongs to the one who made you.
[Mosiah 2:26] Even me, your king, ain't better than y'all...I'm straight-up made from dust too. You see me gettin' old and soon I'm handing this mortal drip back to mother earth.
[Mosiah 2:27] Like I said, I served y'all with a clean conscience before God, and now I got you all together so I stay blameless and don't catch your blood on me when I face God's judgment for what He told me to do about y'all.
[Mosiah 2:28] I had y'all gather so I could wash off your blood from my cloak before I hit the grave, aiming to go down in peace and have my immortal spirit join the heavenly squad singing props to the just God.
[Mosiah 2:29] Also, I got y'all together to drop the news that I can't be your teacher or king no more, say less.
[Mosiah 2:30] Real talk, my whole body's shaking just trying to speak, but God's got me and let me drop this: my son Mosiah is officially king and ruler over y'all now.
[Mosiah 2:31] Yo, fam, keep vibin' like you have...sticking to my commands and my dad's, which has kept you winning and dodging enemies. Same deal if you follow my son's or God's commands through him...you'll keep thriving and your foes won't stand a chance.
[Mosiah 2:32] But yo, watch out, people...don't let beef pop off between you or get tricked into obeying that evil spirit my dad Mosiah warned about.
[Mosiah 2:33] Heads up: whoever vibes with that evil spirit catches a serious L...if they stay stuck in sin and die like that, they're basically sipping on eternal damnation, 'cause they broke God's law knowing full well the tea.
[Mosiah 2:34] Listen up, everyone but the little kids already know they owe God big time...everything they have and are; y'all also got schooled on the records with prophecies from the holy prophets all the way back to when Lehi bounced from Jerusalem.
[Mosiah 2:35] Plus, everything our ancestors said up to now was straight from the Lord's orders, so those words are legit and true, no cap.
[Mosiah 2:36] So, fam, now that you know the facts and got schooled, if you go against what's been said and ghost the Spirit of the Lord, you're blocking the vibe that guides you to wisdom, blessings, and staying solid.
[Mosiah 2:37] Deadass, anyone who does this goes full-on rebel against God, vibes with the evil spirit, becomes enemy of all that's right, and leaves no room for the Lord...he's not living in any holy crib.
[Mosiah 2:38] So if that dude doesn't repent and stays an enemy till death, divine justice will hit his soul hard, making him cringe at God's presence, packed with guilt, pain, and endless fire vibes that never quit.
[Mosiah 2:39] Straight up, mercy's not coming through for that guy...his last stop is eternal torment, no cap.
[Mosiah 2:40] Yo old heads, young bucks, and even kids who get me...I've kept it 100 so you understand, pray you wake up remembering how grim it is for those who slipped into sin.
[Mosiah 2:41] Also, think on the mad blessed and happy life of those who keep God's commands...they're winning in every way, body and soul; if they stay loyal till the end, they get the ultimate invite to chill with God forever in peak happiness. Remember, this is straight facts...the Lord God said it.
[Mosiah 3:1] Yo fam, listen up again...I got more to spill, some real info about what's coming down the line.
[Mosiah 3:2] The stuff I'm about to drop was straight-up told to me by a God-sent angel. He's like, "Wake up," so I did, and boom...there he was right in front of me.
[Mosiah 3:3] He was like, "Wake up and listen close...I'm here to spill the hype news that's all about major joy."
[Mosiah 3:4] The Lord's been peeping your prayers, checked your righteousness, and sent me to drop the news so you can flex joy...and spread that vibe to your crew too.
[Mosiah 3:5] Yo, the time's almost here when the Lord Omnipotent, eternal OG, will slide down from heaven, rock a human body, and flex hard with miracles...healing the sick, raising the dead, making lame folks walk, blind peepers see, deaf ears hear, and curing every sickness.
[Mosiah 3:6] He's gonna yeet out devils and evil spirits chilling in people's hearts, no cap.
[Mosiah 3:7] For real, he's gonna catch mad pain...temptations, hunger, thirst, straight-up exhaustion...more than any human can handle unless it's death; his blood gonna drip from every pore 'cause he's feeling every ounce of pain for his people's wickedness and trash moves.
[Mosiah 3:8] He's gonna be called Jesus Christ, God's Son...the OG Creator of everything...and his mom's name? Mary, no cap.
[Mosiah 3:9] So he's rolling up to his own people so salvation can drop for everyone who's got faith in his name...but no cap, they'll still think he's sus, call him demon-possessed, beat him down, and crucify him.
[Mosiah 3:10] He's bouncing back up on day three, standing tall to judge the world...this whole saga's so justice can flex on humanity, no cap.
[Mosiah 3:11] Peep this...his blood covers the sins of folks who slipped up 'cause of Adam's mess, died clueless about God's plan, or sinned straight-up by accident.
[Mosiah 3:12] But real talk, big L for anyone who knows they're flexing against God! No salvation drops for them unless they hit up repentance and trust the Lord Jesus Christ, no cap.
[Mosiah 3:13] God's holy prophets have been sent worldwide, dropping the tea to every crew and language, so whoever vibes with Christ coming can get their sins wiped and flex that mad joy like He's already here.
[Mosiah 3:14] The Lord saw his squad was mad stubborn, so he hit them with the law...the whole Moses package...no cap.
[Mosiah 3:15] He flexed with mad signs, wonders, and hints about his coming, prophets kept preaching it, but they stayed stubborn and slept on the fact that Moses' law is useless without his blood's atonement.
[Mosiah 3:16] Even if tiny kids could sin, they'd be toast without salvation; but low-key, they're blessed because just like Adam's slip-up, Christ's blood covers their mess too.
[Mosiah 3:17] Real talk, no other name, way, or hack gets you salvation...only through Christ, the Lord Omnipotent, no cap.
[Mosiah 3:18] He's the judge and keeps it 100; babies who pass early ain't lost, but grown folks catch damnation if they don't humble up, get childlike faith, and believe salvation's all about Christ's atoning blood, past, present, and future...Lord Omnipotent style.
[Mosiah 3:19] The natural man's lowkey God's enemy since Adam fell and stay that way unless he vibes with the Holy Spirit, ditches the old self, levels up to saint status through Christ's atonement, and gets that kid energy...submissive, chill, humble, patient, loving, ready to take whatever the Lord throws like a kid respecting their dad.
[Mosiah 3:20] Bet, the day's coming when everyone's gonna catch the tea about the Savior...every nation, squad, language, and crew will know, no cap.
[Mosiah 3:21] When that moment drops, nobody's gonna be guilt-free before God except little kids, and even then, only if they hit up repentance and faith in the Lord God Omnipotent's name.
[Mosiah 3:22] Even now, after you've schooled your people on what God commanded, they still ain't blameless before Him except as I told you...no shortcut, straight facts only.
[Mosiah 3:23] So yeah, I just dropped what the Lord God straight-up told me to say.
[Mosiah 3:24] The Lord says these words will clap back as receipts against the people on Judgment Day...everyone gets judged by their own moves, good or sus.
[Mosiah 3:25] If they're bad news, they're stuck facing the full horror of their own sins and freaky deeds, making them dodge God's presence and crash into eternal misery with zero comeback...straight-up damnation on themselves.
[Mosiah 3:26] They guzzled the cup of God's wrath, and justice can't ghost them any more than it could deny Adam's fall after biting the forbidden fruit...so mercy's ghosted them forever, no cap.
[Mosiah 3:27] Their suffering's like an unquenchable fire lake, burning nonstop with smoke rising forever...that's God's command, say less. Amen.
[Mosiah 4:1] After King Benjamin finished spitting the angel's message, he looked around and saw the whole squad crashed on the ground, shook by serious fear of the Lord.
[Mosiah 4:2] They low-key saw themselves as dirt, way below dust-level, and all screamed together, "Yo, mercy please! Use Christ's atoning blood so we can get our sins wiped and hearts cleansed; we stan Jesus Christ, Son of God, Creator of everything, who's about to roll up among us humans."
[Mosiah 4:3] Right after they said that, the Lord's Spirit hit them, filling them with mad joy 'cause their sins got wiped clean, and their conscience was chill ... all thanks to their huge faith in Jesus Christ coming, just like King Benjamin said.
[Mosiah 4:4] King Benjamin spoke up again: "Yo, friends and fam, listen up one more time so you catch the rest of what I gotta say."
[Mosiah 4:5] Look, if knowing how dope God is right now woke you up to how nothing and low-key trash your fallen state really is...
[Mosiah 4:6] I'm saying, if you've peeped God's mad goodness, unstoppable power, wisdom, patience, and long-suffering with humans ... plus the atonement set from day one so salvation's locked for anyone who trusts the Lord, keeps His commands, and stays faithful till their mortal days are over ... say less.
[Mosiah 4:7] I'm telling you, this is the person who cops salvation via the atonement set up since day one for every human from Adam's fall till the end of time, no cap.
[Mosiah 4:8] This right here is the only way salvation drops, no backup plan; no one's getting saved without meeting these exact conditions I just laid out.
[Mosiah 4:9] Bet on God; know He exists and made everything in heaven and earth; believe He's got all the wisdom and power everywhere; realize humans can't even flex with the stuff God understands.
[Mosiah 4:10] Also, believe you gotta bounce from your sins, humble up before God, and genuinely ask Him to forgive you; if you really believe this, then go through with it...no cap.
[Mosiah 4:11] I'm telling y'all again, if you've caught God's glory, felt His love, and had your sins wiped, bringing mad joy to your soul, always remember how huge God is, how nada you are, His endless goodness and patience with you unworthy peeps, stay humble AF, call on the Lord daily, and hold tight to faith in what's coming like the angel said.
[Mosiah 4:12] Listen up: if you do this, you'll be vibing with constant joy, soaked in God's love, always have your sins wiped, and keep leveling up in knowing the glory of your Creator and what's real and right.
[Mosiah 4:13] You won't even think about throwing shade or harm; instead, you'll keep the peace and give everyone their legit props.
[Mosiah 4:14] You won't let your kids starve or run around broke; you also won't let them break God's rules, beef with each other, or serve the devil...the OG sin boss and evil spirit our ancestors warned us about, who's totally against all that's right.
[Mosiah 4:15] Instead, you'll school them to live real and chill, to love each other, and to serve one another...no cap.
[Mosiah 4:16] Also, you'll help out anyone who's struggling, share your stuff with those in need, and never ghost a beggar's plea...no sending them off to starve or die.
[Mosiah 4:17] Maybe you'll think: this dude messed up and deserves his struggle, so I'm gonna hold back my help...no food or stuff...'cause his pain is fair game.
[Mosiah 4:18] But I'm telling you, fam, anyone who thinks like that needs a serious glow-up; if they don't repent, they're toast forever...no spot in God's kingdom for them, no cap.
[Mosiah 4:19] Real talk: aren't we all just beggars? We all lean on the same God for everything...food, clothes, gold, silver, and all the drip we flex.
[Mosiah 4:20] And look, right now you've been shouting out to Him, begging for your sins to bounce. Did He just leave you on read? Nah, He flooded you with His Spirit, packed your hearts with hype joy, and shut your mouths 'cause the feels were too real to even speak.
[Mosiah 4:21] So check this: if God...the one who made you and runs your whole life...hooks you up with whatever you ask in faith, then ofc you gotta share what you've got with your squad.
[Mosiah 4:22] If you roast the guy begging for your stuff to survive, just wait...your own judgment will be way worse for holding back what's not even yours but God's, who owns your life too, and you're not even asking for forgiveness or owning up.
[Mosiah 4:23] Real talk, that dude's wealth is gonna fade with him...saying this loud for all the rich folks flexing on this world's stuff.
[Mosiah 4:24] And to the poor who barely get by, especially those who ghost beggars 'cause they're broke...just say in your heart, "I ain't giving 'cause I got nada, but if I had, bet I'd share."
[Mosiah 4:25] If you keep that mindset in your heart, you're good...no guilt. But if not, you're getting played with a legit condemnation 'cause you're salty over what you never got.
[Mosiah 4:26] So, to keep your sins canceled daily and walk clean before God, you gotta share your stuff with the poor...everyone giving what they can...feeding the hungry, clothing the bare, visiting the sick, and helping them out both in vibes and real life, based on what they need.
[Mosiah 4:27] Make sure you do all this with some brain and chill vibes...no need to sprint if you're low-key weak. But for real, stay grinding steady to snag that prize; everything gotta be lined up and on point.
[Mosiah 4:28] And don't forget: if you borrow from your neighbor, pay up like you said you would, or you're throwing out sin vibes...and maybe making your neighbor sin too.
[Mosiah 4:29] Honestly, I can't even list all the ways you can slip up and sin...there's mad routes and hacks, too many to count.
[Mosiah 4:30] Here's the tea: if you don't stay on your grind...checking your thoughts, words, actions, and keeping God's commandments while holding tight to the faith about our Lord's return till the end...you're straight-up doomed. So, fam, remember this and don't ghost on life.
[Mosiah 5:1] So after King Benjamin dropped that speech, he hit up his people, low-key checking if they actually bought into what he just said.
[Mosiah 5:2] They all shouted back in sync, "Bet, we vibe with every word you said, and for real, we know it's legit thanks to the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent flipping our hearts...no cap, we're done with evil, just on that good vibes 24/7."
[Mosiah 5:3] We, too, got major insights into the future thanks to God's endless goodness and Spirit flexing on us; no cap, if needed, we could straight-up prophecy everything.
[Mosiah 5:4] It's the faith we vibed with from our king's words that boosted us to this next-level knowledge, making us flex with some serious joy energy.
[Mosiah 5:5] We're down to sign a pact with God to run His will and obey His commandments all day, every day, so we dodge that eternal hellscape the angel warned about...no sipping on God's wrath juice for us.
[Mosiah 5:6] So yeah, this is what King Benjamin wanted to hear, and he told them straight up: You said the words I needed, and the covenant you made? Pure righteous energy.
[Mosiah 5:7] Since you made that covenant, you're officially called Christ's kids...his sons and daughters...because today He spiritually rebirthed you; your hearts flipped thanks to faith in His name, so you're straight-up born of Him now.
[Mosiah 5:8] Under this boss, you get real freedom...no other head unlocks that. Salvation ain't coming through any other name, so if you've signed that covenant with God, flex that Christ name and stay obedient till your last breath.
[Mosiah 5:9] Anyone who stays on this path will be spotted chillin' at God's right hand, knowing the name they rep...straight up called by the name of Christ.
[Mosiah 5:10] But real talk, if you don't rock the name of Christ, you're gonna get stuck with some other label...and that's how you end up on God's left side.
[Mosiah 5:11] Just remember, this name I promised you won't get erased...unless you mess up big time; so keep it 100 and don't let it get wiped from your heart.
[Mosiah 5:12] For real, keep that name tattooed in your heart so you don't end up on God's left side, but instead hear and recognize the voice calling you...and know the name you'll be called by.
[Mosiah 5:13] How you gonna know your master if you never served Him, treat Him like a stranger, and He's nowhere near your thoughts or vibes?
[Mosiah 5:14] Yo, would you take your neighbor's donkey and keep it chillin' with your crew? Nah, you'd kick it out for real. Same deal with you...if you don't know the name you rep, you're getting shown the door.
[Mosiah 5:15] So, stay solid and unshakable, grinding in good deeds nonstop, so Christ, the big boss God, can seal you as His...and flex you up to heaven for eternal salvation and life, powered by His wisdom, justice, and mercy...God above all, no cap. Amen.
[Mosiah 6:1] King Benjamin, done dropping knowledge on the crowd, thought it was smart to jot down the names of everyone who signed the covenant to keep God's commands.
[Mosiah 6:2] Low-key, everyone but the little kids had already signed the covenant and flexed the name of Christ on themselves.
[Mosiah 6:3] After wrapping up his speech, King Benjamin crowned his son Mosiah king and gave him the full rundown on ruling, plus set up priests to school the people so they'd remember God's commandments and their oath; then he let everyone bounce back to their fams and homes.
[Mosiah 6:4] Mosiah took over the throne from his dad at age 30, kicking off his reign about 476 years after Lehi dipped from Jerusalem.
[Mosiah 6:5] King Benjamin stuck around for three more years, then checked out.
[Mosiah 6:6] King Mosiah walked tight with the Lord, obeyed His laws, and kept every command like a boss, no cap.
[Mosiah 6:7] King Mosiah made sure his people were farming, and he got his own hands dirty too, so he wouldn't be a weight on them...keeping it 100 like his dad did; no beef popped off among the squad for three years straight.
[Mosiah 7:1] After three years of chill vibes, King Mosiah got curious about the folks who dipped to Lehi-Nephi 'cause his people hadn't heard a peep since they bounced from Zarahemla...and their constant nagging was low-key stressing him out.
[Mosiah 7:2] So King Mosiah gave the green light for sixteen of their toughest dudes to roll up to Lehi-Nephi to check on their homies.
[Mosiah 7:3] Next day, the squad rolled out with Ammon, a total beast and Zarahemla's descendant, flexing as their main dude.
[Mosiah 7:4] These guys had zero GPS in the wild, so they ended up wandering for like 40 days straight, lost AF trying to reach Lehi-Nephi.
[Mosiah 7:5] After 40 days of wild wandering, they finally hit a hill north of Shilom and set up camp there.
[Mosiah 7:6] Ammon grabbed three bros...Amaleki, Helem, and Hem...and they dipped down into the land of Nephi.
[Mosiah 7:7] They rolled up and ran into the king of Nephi and Shilom, but the king's guards circled them up, cuffed them, and threw them in jail, no cap.
[Mosiah 7:8] After two days locked up, they got called back before the king, their chains popped off, and they were told...more like ordered...to spill the tea on whatever he asked.
[Mosiah 7:9] He said, "Yo, I'm Limhi, son of Noah, son of Zeniff, who bounced from Zarahemla to claim our OG family land...and yeah, the people crowned me king, no cap."
[Mosiah 7:10] Now, I'm tryna know why y'all had the rizz to roll up close to the city walls when I was literally posted with my guards outside the gate?
[Mosiah 7:11] I kept y'all alive just so I could ask these questions...otherwise, my guards would've yeeted you dead. Now spill.
[Mosiah 7:12] When Ammon got the green light to talk, he bowed low to the king, then stood up and said, "Yo king, big ups to God I'm still breathing and can speak...gonna keep it 100 and be bold."
[Mosiah 7:13] Bet if you actually knew me, you wouldn't have let me rock these chains. I'm Ammon, straight up Zarahemla's descendant, and I came from there to check on our bros Zeniff brought out.
[Mosiah 7:14] After hearing Ammon, Limhi got mad hype and said, "No cap, I'm sure my bros in Zarahemla are still alive. I'm gonna vibe on this, and tomorrow my people gonna catch the same W."
[Mosiah 7:15] Look, we're low-key slaves to the Lamanites and stuck with a brutal tax. But our bros gonna free us from that grind, even if we gotta be their slaves...better to serve Nephites than get taxed by the Lamanite king, no cap.
[Mosiah 7:16] King Limhi told his guards to stop cuffing Ammon and his crew, then had them fetch their bros from the hill north of Shilom so everyone could eat, drink, and catch a break...they'd been thru mad hunger, thirst, and straight-up exhaustion.
[Mosiah 7:17] Next day, King Limhi dropped an announcement to squad up at the temple so they could catch his speech, no cap.
[Mosiah 7:18] When the crew gathered, he told them, "Yo fam, hold your heads up and chill...real talk, the day's near when we break free from our haters. Even if past fights felt like L's, I believe we still got one big W left in us."
[Mosiah 7:19] So, keep your heads high, flex joy, and trust God...the same God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob...who bounced Israel outta Egypt, partied the Red Sea dry, fed them manna so they didn't ghost in the wilderness, and did mad more for them.
[Mosiah 7:20] And that same God pulled our ancestors from Jerusalem and kept us safe up to now, but low-key, we're in chains 'cause of our own mess-ups and bad vibes.
[Mosiah 7:21] Y'all are witnesses today that Zeniff, hyped to claim his dads' land, got played hard by King Laman's slick moves...Laman made a deal with Zeniff, handing over part of the land, including Lehi-Nephi, Shilom, and the surrounding area.
[Mosiah 7:22] He pulled all this just to lock us down in slavery. Right now, we're paying the Lamanite king half our corn, barley, every grain, half the beef and sheep gains...straight up half our entire stash or our lives, no cap.
[Mosiah 7:23] Ain't this straight-up brutal to carry? Our suffering's mad real, fam. No cap, we got every reason to be straight-up sad.
[Mosiah 7:24] Deadass, we got huge reasons to mourn...so many of our bros got killed, their blood spilled for nothing, all 'cause of straight-up sin.
[Mosiah 7:25] If our people hadn't dipped into sin, God wouldn't have let this mess hit us. But they ghosted His words and started beefing so bad they even spilled each other's blood.
[Mosiah 7:26] They straight-up killed a Lord's prophet...a chosen dude who called out their wickedness and prophesied big stuff, even the coming of Christ.
[Mosiah 7:27] He said straight up that Christ is God, the OG Father of everything, who'd flex human form...like man was made in His image from the jump...and that God would slide into flesh and blood to roam the earth.
[Mosiah 7:28] Since he said all that, they straight murdered him, and did plenty more stuff that riled God up big time. So, who's shocked they're stuck in chains and getting hit with mad suffering?
[Mosiah 7:29] God said straight up: I won't save my people when they're messing up; instead, I'll block their moves so they can't glow up, and their bad actions will trip them up every time.
[Mosiah 7:30] And He drops this: if my people plant dirt, they'll catch the trash in the storm, and what comes out is pure venom.
[Mosiah 7:31] He also says: if my people plant filth, they'll catch the east wind...bringing instant wreckage, no cap.
[Mosiah 7:32] Look, God's promise came through...y'all getting smacked and twisted up real bad.
[Mosiah 7:33] But if y'all bounce back to God with mad honesty, trust Him fully, and serve hard with your whole brain, He'll, no cap, break you out of those chains when He's ready.
[Mosiah 8:1] After king Limhi dropped his speech...he said a lot, but only some made it in this book...he filled his people in on their bros chillin' in Zarahemla.
[Mosiah 8:2] Limhi had Ammon step up in front of the crowd and spill all the tea about their bros...from Zeniff bouncing outta the land up to when Ammon himself dipped.
[Mosiah 8:3] Ammon also replayed king Benjamin's final words and broke them down so Limhi's squad could catch all the meaning, no cap.
[Mosiah 8:4] After all that, king Limhi told the crowd to dip and head back to their own spots.
[Mosiah 8:5] Then he had the plates with his people's story from when they bounced Zarahemla brought to Ammon so he could peep and read them.
[Mosiah 8:6] Once Ammon peeped the record, the king asked if he could decode the languages ... Ammon kept it real and said nah, he couldn't.
[Mosiah 8:7] The king said, low-key stressed about my people's struggles, I sent 43 of my crew into the wild to find Zarahemla, hoping our bros there could break us outta this mess.
[Mosiah 8:8] They got lost in the wilderness mad days, stayed grinding though, never found Zarahemla, came back to this spot after wandering lands full of water, bones of humans and beasts everywhere, plus ruins of all kinds of buildings from a squad as massive as Israel's host.
[Mosiah 8:9] To prove they're not capping, they brought 24 gold plates packed with engravings straight-up receipts.
[Mosiah 8:10] Also, they rolled up with big breastplates made of brass and copper, and they're still solid, no cap.
[Mosiah 8:11] They also brought swords...handles rotted and blades rusty AF...and no one around can read the language or the engravings on the plates. That's why I asked if you can translate, fr.
[Mosiah 8:12] So, I'm asking again: you know anyone who can translate? I want these records flipped into our language, maybe they spill tea on a remnant of the wiped-out peeps who made these plates, or maybe they explain why this same crew got totally destroyed ... I'm low-key desperate to know the receipts on their downfall.
[Mosiah 8:13] Ammon told him straight up: I know a dude who can translate these records, king. He's got these dope interpreters...like divine AF glasses...that let him read any old records. No one can just peep them without a command, or they'll catch a L and maybe even die. Those who get the green light? They're called seers, no cap.
[Mosiah 8:14] And check it, the king over in Zarahemla is the guy who's got the boss-level command and this legit gift from God to handle all this.
[Mosiah 8:15] The king said straight up: a seer's got more juice than a prophet, no cap.
[Mosiah 8:16] Ammon said a seer's basically a revelator and prophet rolled into one; no one can flex a bigger gift unless they've got straight-up God power, and nobody can snag that ... but God can still bless a dude with mad power.
[Mosiah 8:17] But a seer's got the plug on past and future stuff; through them, all secrets get exposed, hidden tea spills, and unknown facts get flexed...things that straight-up couldn't be known otherwise.
[Mosiah 8:18] God set it up so humans, through faith, can pull off crazy miracles and end up being a big W for their squad.
[Mosiah 8:19] After Ammon dropped that knowledge, the king got mad hyped and gave props to God, saying: No cap, these plates hold some serious mysteries, and these interpreters were defs made to spill all that tea to us humans.
[Mosiah 8:20] Yo, God's works are straight-up marvelous, and He's mad patient with us, but low-key people's minds be blind and sus...they don't wanna chase wisdom or let her run the show!
[Mosiah 8:21] They're like a wild squad ghosting their shepherd, scattering everywhere, getting chased down, and straight-up eaten by the forest beasts.
[Mosiah 9:1] I, Zeniff, schooled in all Nephite lingo and schooled on Nephi's land...the OG fam's turf...was sent to lowkey spy on the Lamanites so our army could roll up and wreck them; but when I peeped their good side, I was kinda vibing that they shouldn't get wiped out.
[Mosiah 9:2] So I clashed hard with my bros in the wilderness, pushing for peace talks, but our ruler was straight savage and wanted me dead; things got messy...fam beef everywhere, blood spilled, half our army got yeeted in the wild, and the survivors bounced back to Zarahemla to spill the tea to their fam.
[Mosiah 9:3] Still, I was mad eager to claim our fam's land, so I gathered anyone down to roll with me, and we took off into the wilderness again...but got hit with a brutal famine and tough times because we low-key forgot to remember the Lord our God.
[Mosiah 9:4] After mad days of wandering the wilderness, we finally set up camp near where our bros got killed, right by our fam's old turf.
[Mosiah 9:5] So I rolled back to the city with four dudes to check the king's vibe and see if we could move in with our people and claim the land without beef.
[Mosiah 9:6] I pulled up to the king, and he straight up made a deal letting me claim the lands of Lehi-Nephi and Shilom.
[Mosiah 9:7] He also told his squad to bounce from the land, so me and my crew moved in to claim it for real.
[Mosiah 9:8] We got to work, building up structures and fixing the city walls, both in Lehi-Nephi and Shilom, no cap.
[Mosiah 9:9] We started grinding the soil with all kinds of seeds...corn, wheat, barley, neas, sheum, and fruits...and low-key started thriving and flexing in the land.
[Mosiah 9:10] King Laman was mad sneaky, handing over the land so he could low-key trap my people in bondage later.
[Mosiah 9:11] So after chilling in the land for twelve years, King Laman started getting sus, scared my squad would get too strong and he wouldn't be able to oppress us.
[Mosiah 9:12] These guys were straight lazy and idol-worshipping, so they wanted to drag us into slavery just to pig out on the fruits of our grind, living off our hard work and flocks.
[Mosiah 9:13] So King Laman started hyping up his squad to beef with mine, and boom...wars and drama exploded all over the land.
[Mosiah 9:14] Year thirteen of my reign in Nephi, down south of Shilom, while my peeps were minding their flocks and fields, a huge Lamanite squad rolled up, started slaying folks, and snatched their flocks and corn.
[Mosiah 9:15] Yeah, anyone who dodged the attack dipped to Nephi city and hit me up for backup, no cap.
[Mosiah 9:16] So I hooked them up with bows, arrows, swords, scimitars, clubs, slings...basically every weapon we could dream up...and me and my crew rolled out to throw hands with the Lamanites.
[Mosiah 9:17] Straight up powered by the Lord's strength, we rolled to battle, shouting mad prayers for rescue 'cause we remembered how our ancestors got their epic saves.
[Mosiah 9:18] God heard our SOS and flexed His power through us; in just one day and night, we clapped 3,043 Lamanites and straight-up bounced them off our turf.
[Mosiah 9:19] I personally dug the graves for the fallen, and fr, it hit hard...279 of our own got taken out, big L's and serious sadness.
[Mosiah 10:1] We rebooted the kingdom and chilled on the land, but I made sure we had every kind of war gear ready for when the Lamanites tried to drag us back into beef.
[Mosiah 10:2] I posted guards all around so the Lamanites couldn't sneak up and wreck us again...peacekeeping my people and flocks, keeping them safe from enemy clout.
[Mosiah 10:3] We snagged the land from our ancestors and flexed it for 22 years straight, no cap.
[Mosiah 10:4] I had the guys grinding the soil, growing every kind of grain and fruit they could think of, no cap.
[Mosiah 10:5] I got the women spinning and grinding, making all kinds of fine linen and cloth to keep us covered; meanwhile, we were thriving and vibing in peace for 22 years straight.
[Mosiah 10:6] King Laman kicked the bucket, his son took over and started hyping a rebellion against us; so naturally, they prepped for war and rolled up ready to throw down.
[Mosiah 10:7] I low-key deployed spies all over Shemlon to catch their moves early and keep my squad from getting caught slippin' and wiped out.
[Mosiah 10:8] They rolled up north of Shilom with mad troops packing bows, arrows, swords, scimitars, stones, and slings; rocking shaved heads and leather belts, looking raw and ready for action.
[Mosiah 10:9] I had the women and kids bounce to the wilderness for safety, then rounded up every old and young dude who could flex a weapon, lining them up by age to face the Lamanites head-on.
[Mosiah 10:10] We rolled up for battle against the Lamanites, and yeah, I even showed up old but still strapped; we went in powered by the Lord's strength, no cap.
[Mosiah 10:11] The Lamanites were clueless about the Lord's power, so they flexed their own muscle...no cap, they were legit strong, just human strength though.
[Mosiah 10:12] They were savage and straight-up thirsty for blood, stuck on their old-school vibes...thinking they got bounced from Jerusalem 'cause their ancestors messed up, and that their fam played them dirty in the wilderness and even on the sea crossing.
[Mosiah 10:13] Plus, they felt played again in their OG land after crossing the sea...all 'cause Nephi was way more loyal to the Lord's rules, so God gave him the main-character energy, answered his prayers, and let him lead the wilderness trek.
[Mosiah 10:14] His own bros were straight-up salty at him 'cause they didn't get how the Lord was playing it, and even on the boat they stayed mad, hearts stone-cold against God.
[Mosiah 10:15] When they hit the promised land, they got mad AF saying Nephi snatched control from the squad, so they tried to off him...straight-up betrayal vibes.
[Mosiah 10:16] They also beefed with him 'cause he bounced into the wilderness like the Lord said and took the brass plates, calling him a straight-up thief.
[Mosiah 10:17] So they schooled their kids to hate, kill, steal, and wreck Nephi's crew...basically passing down eternal beef with Nephi's fam.
[Mosiah 10:18] King Laman played me with slick lies and fake promises, so I led my people here just for them to get wrecked; we've been catching these L's in this land for years, no cap.
[Mosiah 10:19] So, me, Zeniff, after spilling all this tea about the Lamanites to my people, hyped them up to throw hands with mad trust in the Lord; we squared up and faced them head-on, no cap.
[Mosiah 10:20] We straight-up pushed them outta our land again and clapped so many they were too many to count, no receipts needed.
[Mosiah 10:21] We bounced back to our turf, and my people got back to the grind...hustling with their flocks and farming the land like pros.
[Mosiah 10:22] Now that I'm old, I passed the crown to one of my sons, so I'm done talking; Lord bless my crew, amen.
[Mosiah 11:1] So Zeniff handed the kingdom to his son Noah, who took the throne...but low-key, Noah didn't vibe with his dad's ways at all.
[Mosiah 11:2] Noah ghosted God's commandments and chased his own cravings, stacking wives and concubines, leading his squad to sin big time...wild whoredoms and all sorts of sus wickedness that had God shook.
[Mosiah 11:3] Noah flexed a 20% tax on everything...gold, silver, ziff, copper, brass, iron, fatlings, even their grain...straight robbing the homies blind.
[Mosiah 11:4] He scooped all that cash to bankroll himself, his wives, concubines, plus his priests and their crews...talk about flipping the kingdom's whole vibe.
[Mosiah 11:5] He straight-up axed his dad's OG priests and plugged in new ones who were mad full of themselves, flexing with hella pride.
[Mosiah 11:6] Yeah, those priests got fat off the lazy life, idol worship, and wild whoredoms...all funded by King Noah's savage taxes...so the people were grinding hard just to bankroll straight-up sin.
[Mosiah 11:7] The people got sus and started worshipping idols, all coz they drank the king and priests' fake hype and sweet talk...straight up gaslighting vibes.
[Mosiah 11:8] King Noah flexed hard, building hella fancy, roomy spots decked out with woodwork and blinged-up with gold, silver, iron, brass, ziff, and copper...straight drip everywhere.
[Mosiah 11:9] He also copped a huge palace with a throne front and center, all crafted from fine wood and iced out with gold, silver, and mad precious stuff...total main-character energy.
[Mosiah 11:10] Noah made his crew grind on all kinds of fancy wood, copper, and brass work inside the temple walls...no cap, he was all about that glow-up.
[Mosiah 11:11] He blinged out the high priests' seats with pure gold and threw up a breastwork so they could kick back while spitting fake, empty words to the people...straight masters of the big lie.
[Mosiah 11:12] So, he built this mad tall tower by the temple, high enough to flex from the top with a full view over Shilom, Shemlon...Lamanite turf...and basically the whole hood around.
[Mosiah 11:13] He made a bunch of buildings pop up in Shilom and threw up a huge tower on the hill north of Shilom...a spot where Nephi's crew once dipped when they fled...using the riches he snatched from taxing his people.
[Mosiah 11:14] He got mad hung up on his stacks, living it up wild with his wives and concubines, while his priests were busy doing the same with harlots...straight-up party mode, no chill.
[Mosiah 11:15] He planted vineyards all over, built wine-presses, and brewed mad wine; no cap, he and his people got addicted to that wine life.
[Mosiah 11:16] Then the Lamanites started lowkey rolling up in small squads, straight up slaying his people while they were just minding their fields and flocks.
[Mosiah 11:17] King Noah threw some guards around the land to block the Lamanites but sent weak numbers; the Lamanites crushed them, jacked a ton of their flocks, and started wrecking them hardcore with mad hate.
[Mosiah 11:18] King Noah sent his armies at the Lamanites, and they either got bounced or bounced them back for a bit; so they rolled home flexing on their loot, all hyped.
[Mosiah 11:19] After that big W, they got hella cocky, hyping their own strength like fifty could take on thousands of Lamanites, flexing hard, vibing on bloodshed of their own fam...all thanks to their king and priests' toxic vibes.
[Mosiah 11:20] There was this dude, Abinadi, who rolled up to the crowd and started dropping prophetic bars: "Yo, the Lord told me to say...big L for you guys 'cause I peeped your nasty sins and wild wickedness; unless you pull up and repent, His wrath's coming full send."
[Mosiah 11:21] If they don't switch up and bounce back to God, I'm telling you, He's about to hand them over to their enemies who'll lock them down and put them through mad suffering.
[Mosiah 11:22] For real, they'll learn I'm the Lord their God...jealous AF...and I don't let my people slide with their sins without paying the price.
[Mosiah 11:23] Straight up, if these folks don't repent and come back to the Lord their God, they'll get snapped into bondage with zero help...only the Almighty Lord can save them.
[Mosiah 11:24] For real, when they finally scream out to me, I'll low-key ghost their cries for a bit and let their enemies whoop them hard.
[Mosiah 11:25] Unless they come clean in sackcloth and ashes and scream to the Lord with all they got, He won't hear them or rescue them from their pain...straight from the Lord's mouth, no cap.
[Mosiah 11:26] After Abinadi dropped those truth bombs, they got mad salty and tried to end him, but the Lord swooped in and saved him from their grip.
[Mosiah 11:27] When King Noah caught wind of Abinadi's clapback, he got triggered and was like, "Who even is this Abinadi to judge me and my squad? And who's this Lord dude bringing all this heat on us?"
[Mosiah 11:28] "Yo, bring Abinadi here so I can snuff him...he's been talking mad trash trying to stir up beef and drama among my people; I'm about to put him down for that."
[Mosiah 11:29] The people went straight blind to the truth and toughened up against Abinadi's words, hunting him nonstop; meanwhile, King Noah doubled down on his mad evil and refused to repent, heart on lockdown.
[Mosiah 12:1] Two years later, Abinadi low-key rolled up undercover, no one peeped him, and started prophesying: "The Lord said, 'Abinadi, spill the tea to these stubborn folks who've blocked my messages and ain't bounced back from their bad moves...so I'm coming in full rage to clap back on their sins and gross acts.'"
[Mosiah 12:2] Big yikes for this generation! The Lord told me to flex my hand and say: Because of their sins, they'll get locked down, slapped in the face, chased by haters, killed, and their bodies left for vultures, dogs, and wild beasts to feast on...no cap.
[Mosiah 12:3] King Noah's life's gonna feel like fresh laundry in a blazing furnace...straight up destroyed...and he'll finally get that I'm the Lord, no cap.
[Mosiah 12:4] I'm about to hit my people hard with serious L's...famine, plague...you name it, making them cry out nonstop all day long.
[Mosiah 12:5] Straight up, I'll load heavy burdens on their backs and push them around like clueless donkeys, no rizz at all.
[Mosiah 12:6] I'm sending hail to clap them down, plus that savage east wind, and bugs gonna swarm their land, munching all their crops...major sad vibes.
[Mosiah 12:7] They'll catch a brutal plague...I'm talking big-time smiting...all 'cause of their nasty sins and straight-up abominations, no cap.
[Mosiah 12:8] If they don't bounce back, I'll wipe them off the earth, no survivors; but they'll leave receipts behind, and I'll keep them for future nations to peep their mess...Abinadi dropped mad prophecies roasting these people hard.
[Mosiah 12:9] They got heated at Abinadi, snatched him up, and dragged him bound to the king like, "Yo, here's a dude spitting straight-up doom, saying God's gonna wreck your people."
[Mosiah 12:10] He's also throwing shade on your life, saying you'll get roasted like clothes in a blazing furnace, no cap.
[Mosiah 12:11] Plus, he says you'll be like a dry weed in the field...just crushed and stomped on by beasts, totally trashed.
[Mosiah 12:12] He's saying you'll be like a thistle's flower, ripe and ready to get blown around all over the place; he claims the Lord said this, and none of it stops unless you repent...this 'cause of your sins, no cap.
[Mosiah 12:13] Yo king, what massive screw-up did you or your squad pull that got God or this dude throwing shade and judging y'all?
[Mosiah 12:14] Listen up king, we're clean, you didn't mess up, so this guy's just cap...spitting fake prophecies with zero receipts.
[Mosiah 12:15] Look, we're built different...no chains, no captives here; you've been thriving in this land and the glow-up's just getting started for you.
[Mosiah 12:16] Here's the guy, king...he's all yours; do whatever you want with him, say less.
[Mosiah 12:17] So King Noah locked Abinadi up and called his priests for a squad meeting to figure out what to do with the dude.
[Mosiah 12:18] They told the king, "Pull him up here so we can grill him," and the king ordered to bring Abinadi right in front of them.
[Mosiah 12:19] They started grilling him, trying to catch him slippin' to drag him, but Abinadi clapped back hard, shutting down every question and leaving them shook, totally owning the convo.
[Mosiah 12:20] Then one of them was like, "Yo, what's the tea on these words from our ancestors that we've been taught?"
[Mosiah 12:21] "How lit are the feet on the mountains of the one dropping good news, flexing peace, spreading salvation vibes, and telling Zion, 'Your God's the real MVP'?"
[Mosiah 12:22] Your watchmen gonna squad up, raise their voices, singing in sync 'cause they'll vibe together when the Lord brings Zion back.
[Mosiah 12:23] Burst out hyped, sing up, all you empty spots in Jerusalem...God's comforted his crew and redeemed the city, no cap.
[Mosiah 12:24] God's flexing His holy power for all nations to peep, and the whole world's gonna catch the glow-up of our salvation, bet.
[Mosiah 12:25] Then Abinadi clapped back, "Y'all priests acting like you run the show and get prophecy, but now you wanna hit me up for the real meaning? Sus much."
[Mosiah 12:26] I'm telling you straight: big Ls for twisting God's ways! If you get this stuff but ain't teaching it right, you're low-key messing up the whole vibe of the Lord's path.
[Mosiah 12:27] You didn't even put in the brainwork, so you're acting dumb...so what the hell are you even teaching these folks?
[Mosiah 12:28] They clapped back, "We're out here teaching the law of Moses, no cap."
[Mosiah 12:29] Abinadi hit them with, "If you're preaching Moses' law, why you not living it? Why you chasing bags, running wild with harlots, dragging this whole crew into sin till the Lord had to send me to drop prophecy about big trouble coming?"
[Mosiah 12:30] Don't you get that I'm spitting facts? For real, you know I'm telling the truth, so you better be shaking in your boots before God.
[Mosiah 12:31] You're gonna catch these hands for your sins, claiming you teach Moses' law...but what do you even know about it? Does salvation roll through Moses' law? Spill.
[Mosiah 12:32] They shot back, "Nah, salvation does come through Moses' law, no cap."
[Mosiah 12:33] Abinadi clapped back, "Look, I know if y'all actually keep God's commandments, you'll be saved...yeah, even the ones the Lord dropped on Moses up at Mount Sinai, say less."
[Mosiah 12:34] I'm the Lord your God, the one who hauled you out of Egypt, straight outta that house of bondage...no cap.
[Mosiah 12:35] Don't put any other god above me, got it? I'm the main account here.
[Mosiah 12:36] Don't go crafting any idols or copies of stuff in the sky or on earth, keep it real with me only.
[Mosiah 12:37] Abinadi threw down, "You done all this? Nah, you haven't. And you been telling people to do it? Still nah, you ghosted that mission."
[Mosiah 13:1] When the king caught those words, he told his priests, "Get this dude outta here and kill him...what do we even need with this guy? He's straight-up sus and crazy."
[Mosiah 13:2] They stepped up tryna grab him, but he held his ground and clapped back at them:
[Mosiah 13:3] Hands off, or God's gonna clap back hard if you touch me...I ain't even spilled the full tea God sent me with, and I didn't say the stuff you asked for, so God's keeping me safe for now, no cap.
[Mosiah 13:4] I gotta stick to God's commands, and yeah, dropping truth got you heated. Plus, since I spoke God's word, y'all just called me crazy...sus move.
[Mosiah 13:5] After Abinadi said all that, king Noah's crew didn't even try to touch him...Lord's Spirit was on him, and his face was flexing that mad glow, like Moses up on Sinai chatting with God.
[Mosiah 13:6] He kept it 100, speaking with God's authority and power, dropping bars like:
[Mosiah 13:7] Y'all see you can't off me, so I'ma finish my message. Bet it hits different 'cause I'm calling out your sins straight up, and it's low-key killing you inside.
[Mosiah 13:8] No cap, my words got you shook, amazed, and mad all at once...pretty wild, huh?
[Mosiah 13:9] I'm done dropping the message; after that, wherever I end up doesn't even matter as long as I'm saved, say less.
[Mosiah 13:10] Just so you know, whatever y'all do to me next is basically a sneak peek...like a trailer for what's coming down the line.
[Mosiah 13:11] Alright, I'm about to drop the rest of God's commands since it's clear y'all didn't even vibe with them in your hearts; low-key, you've been majorly into teaching and living sin most of your lives.
[Mosiah 13:12] Remember when I told you not to flex with any idols or pics of stuff from heaven, earth, or the deep waters? Yeah, no cap on that.
[Mosiah 13:13] And no cap, don't bow or serve those idols...I'm the Lord, a jealous God who hits the hate real deep, dragging the mess down through three or four generations.
[Mosiah 13:14] But on the flip, I show mad mercy to thousands who love me and stick to my commandments, no cap.
[Mosiah 13:15] Don't be flexin' with the Lord's name for nothing; He won't let anyone off the hook who does that, no cap.
[Mosiah 13:16] Don't forget to keep the Sabbath day chill and holy, like for real.
[Mosiah 13:17] Grind for six days straight and handle all your business, bet.
[Mosiah 13:18] But on the seventh day, the Lord's Sabbath, no cap...no work for you, your kids, your squad, your servants, your animals, or even strangers chilling in your spot.
[Mosiah 13:19] God made heaven, earth, and the sea in six days, so He blessed the Sabbath and made it sacred...big facts.
[Mosiah 13:20] Show mad respect to your parents so you can vibe long in the land God hooks you up with, no cap.
[Mosiah 13:21] Don't go out here killing people...straight up forbidden, no receipts to the contrary.
[Mosiah 13:22] No cheating and no snatching what ain't yours...keep it 100.
[Mosiah 13:23] Don't snitch lies or drag your neighbor with fake receipts, that's straight sus.
[Mosiah 13:24] Don't be low-key thirsty for your neighbor's crib, spouse, staff, ox, donkey, or anything else that's theirs...stay in your lane.
[Mosiah 13:25] When Abinadi dropped those truths, he hit them with, "Y'all actually taught the people to follow these commandments, or nah?"
[Mosiah 13:26] I'm telling you straight, nope; if you had, God wouldn't have sent me to spill bad news on these folks.
[Mosiah 13:27] Y'all say salvation's through Moses' law...bet, keep it for now...but heads up, a time's coming when sticking to that law won't be the move no more.
[Mosiah 13:28] Also, hear me out: salvation isn't just about the law; without the atonement God's gonna handle for our mess-ups, the law alone would leave us toast, no cap.
[Mosiah 13:29] So yeah, it made sense to drop a strict law on Israel since they were mad stubborn, quick to mess up, and slow to remember God.
[Mosiah 13:30] That's why they got laws full of rituals and rules to follow every day, keeping them woke about God and their responsibilities to Him.
[Mosiah 13:31] But real talk, all that stuff was just a preview, vibes pointing to what's coming next.
[Mosiah 13:32] So, did they get the law? Nah, most didn't 'cause their hearts were low-key stiff; they slept on the fact that no one gets saved without God's redemption.
[Mosiah 13:33] Like, didn't Moses drop prophecies about the Messiah coming to save everyone? And tbh, all the prophets since day one have been on that same vibe, talking about this stuff.
[Mosiah 13:34] Haven't they said God's gonna slide down to humans, rock human drip, and flex mad power all over the earth?
[Mosiah 13:35] For real, haven't they also said He'd pull off the resurrection, and Himself catch all the shade and struggles?
[Mosiah 14:1] Straight up, didn't Isaiah ask like, who's actually vibed with our message and who's caught the flex of the Lord's power?
[Mosiah 14:2] He's gonna rise up like a fragile sprout from dry dirt, no fancy looks or glow-up; when we see him, there's nothing that makes us wanna stan.
[Mosiah 14:3] People lowkey hate on him and ghost him; dude's all pain and sadness, we straight-up looked away and didn't give him the respect he deserved.
[Mosiah 14:4] No cap, he carried all our pain and sadness, but we thought he was just getting wrecked by God and dealing with heavy hits.
[Mosiah 14:5] He took the L for our mess-ups, got beat down for our wrongs; the punishment that brings us peace landed on him, and thanks to his wounds, we're healed.
[Mosiah 14:6] We all bounced like lost sheep, doing our own thing, but the Lord put all our mess on him to handle.
[Mosiah 14:7] Dude got crushed and stressed but kept quiet; he rolled up like a lamb to the chop, totally mute like sheep before shearing...no cap, he said nothing.
[Mosiah 14:8] They snatched him from jail and trial; who can even spill tea on his crew? He got cut from the living squad 'cause he ate the blows for my people's sins.
[Mosiah 14:9] He got a plot with the bad and wealthy at his death, even though he was pure...no evil or sus lies came out his mouth.
[Mosiah 14:10] Even so, the Lord was chill with crushing him and making him suffer; when he offers up his soul for sin, he'll see his legacy, live longer, and the Lord's plan will flex hard through him.
[Mosiah 14:11] He'll peep the struggle of his soul and be content; with his wisdom, my righteous servant will clear the record for tons, 'cause he's carrying their mess.
[Mosiah 14:12] So, I'll link him up with the big shots and he'll flex with the strong, since he poured out his soul to death, rolled with the lawless, carried many sins, and prayed hard for the sinners.
[Mosiah 15:1] Abinadi came through like, listen up: God's gonna slide into the human scene and save his squad, no cap.
[Mosiah 15:2] Since he's living that flesh life, he's called the Son of God, and by flexing his flesh to the Father's vibe, he's both the Father and the Son...say less.
[Mosiah 15:3] He's the Father 'cause God powered his conception, and the Son 'cause of the flesh...basically rocking both titles at once.
[Mosiah 15:4] They're one God, straight-up the Eternal Father ruling heaven and earth, no cap.
[Mosiah 15:5] So the flesh vibes with the Spirit, the Son's down with the Father, one God flexing; he faced mad temptation, stayed solid, chose to get roasted, whipped, ghosted, and rejected by his own crew.
[Mosiah 15:6] After all that, dropping mad miracles on humans, he's gonna get led like Isaiah said...like a sheep chillin' before the shearer, silent, no cap, mouth on mute.
[Mosiah 15:7] For real, he's gonna get led, crucified, and killed, flesh bowed down even to death, the Son's will totally swallowed by the Father's plan.
[Mosiah 15:8] So God snaps death's chains, claps death's ass, and hands the Son the power to plead for humanity...straight W energy.
[Mosiah 15:9] After he leveled up to heaven, packed with mad mercy and mad compassion for humans, he's the ultimate middleman between justice and them, crushed death's chains, carried their sins, bought their freedom, and kept justice 100.
[Mosiah 15:10] Yo, who can even flex on his legacy? When his soul's dropped as the ultimate sin-offering, he'll peep his crew. So what's the move? Who's gonna roll as his seed?
[Mosiah 15:11] Listen up: anyone who's caught the holy prophets' tea on the Lord's comeback, believed He'd save his people, and has been hyped for that day to get their sins wiped...those guys? They're his real squad and heirs to God's kingdom.
[Mosiah 15:12] These are the ones he's carried sins for, died to save, snatching them back from their mess-ups. So yeah, they're low-key his legit seed.
[Mosiah 15:13] Bet, isn't every prophet who's spit truth without slipping...like, all the holy prophets since day one...definitely his seed, no cap.
[Mosiah 15:14] These guys dropped peace vibes, spreadin' hype news of salvation, telling Zion straight up: Your God's running the show!
[Mosiah 15:15] Yo, fr, their footsteps on the mountains? Straight-up iconic, mad beautiful vibes.
[Mosiah 15:16] And for real, the ones still handing out peace on the mountains? Their feet stay looking fire, no cap.
[Mosiah 15:17] And peep this...anyone flexin' peace from now and forever? Their mountain strides stay next-level beautiful, no receipts needed.
[Mosiah 15:18] Yo, that's not even the full flex. For real, the feet of the OG peace founder...the Lord who redeemed and saved his people...look mad beautiful on those mountains.
[Mosiah 15:19] No cap, if it wasn't for the redemption He cooked up since day one, everyone would've been straight-up wiped out.
[Mosiah 15:20] Watch, death's chains get snapped, the Son's flexing power over the dead, making resurrection happen no cap.
[Mosiah 15:21] And yo, there's this first resurrection coming for everyone...past, present, future...right up until Christ himself pops back; that's his name for real.
[Mosiah 15:22] So check it, all prophets and anyone vibing with their words or sticking to God's commandments get first dibs in the first resurrection...they're the original resurrection squad.
[Mosiah 15:23] They get lifted up to chill with God who redeemed them, flexing eternal life through Christ, the one who smashed death's chains.
[Mosiah 15:24] These folks riding the first resurrection wave died before Christ showed up, clueless about salvation, but the Lord's got their back, restoring them so they get eternal life too, all redeemed, no cap.
[Mosiah 15:25] Low-key, even little kids flex eternal life...no debate.
[Mosiah 15:26] Real talk, y'all better fear and shake before God...He won't redeem those who straight-up rebel and die stuck in their sins, the ones who've known God's rules but ghosted 'em; these folks ain't getting in the first resurrection squad.
[Mosiah 15:27] So, like, shouldn't you be shook? Salvation's a no-go for these peeps; God didn't redeem them, can't even do it...He ain't about to cancel Himself or dodge justice when it's due.
[Mosiah 15:28] Heads up, the time's gonna drop when the Lord's salvation gets announced to every nation, clan, language, and squad worldwide.
[Mosiah 15:29] For real, Lord's watchmen gonna squad up, raise their voices, sing in sync, 'cause they'll see eye to eye when Zion makes its comeback.
[Mosiah 15:30] Yo, level up and sing loud, all you empty spots of Jerusalem; the Lord just dropped mad comfort and redeemed the city, no cap.
[Mosiah 15:31] God flexed His holy power right in front of every nation, and everyone everywhere's gonna catch the glow-up of our salvation, say less.
[Mosiah 16:1] So after Abinadi dropped that knowledge, he threw up his hand and said: soon every nation, squad, and language will vibe together, seeing God's salvation and agreeing His judgments are straight-up just.
[Mosiah 16:2] Then the wicked get ghosted, left to howl, cry, wail, and grind their teeth...because they dipped on God's voice, so no redemption for them, no cap.
[Mosiah 16:3] These dudes are straight-up carnal and devilish, fully under that OG serpent's control...the one who duped Adam and Eve and kicked off humanity's whole fall, making us all vibe with sin and side with the devil.
[Mosiah 16:4] So yeah, all humanity was totally lost, like no hope in sight, if God hadn't swooped in to redeem His people from that deep fall.
[Mosiah 16:5] But low-key, if someone keeps vibing in their carnal ways, sinning and rebelling against God, they stay stuck in that fallen state with the devil having full clout over them; basically, it's like no redemption even happened...both them and the devil are straight-up enemies to God.
[Mosiah 16:6] Real talk, if Christ hadn't rolled into the world, dropping future facts like they're already done, redemption wouldn't even be a thing.
[Mosiah 16:7] No cap, if Christ hadn't bounced from the dead and broke death's chains, beating the grave and killing death's sting, then resurrection wouldn't even exist.
[Mosiah 16:8] But since resurrection's a fact, the grave's L is locked, and death's sting got totally chewed up by Christ.
[Mosiah 16:9] He's the ultimate light and life for the whole world...an endless glow that never fades and a life that slaps so hard death can't even show up anymore.
[Mosiah 16:10] Even our mortal selves will flex immortality, this decay leveling up to incorruption, all standing before God's bar for the ultimate vibe check...judged by our deeds, good or sus.
[Mosiah 16:11] If they're good, they get resurrected to endless life and mad happiness; but if they're evil, resurrection means endless damnation, handed over to the devil who's got them on lock...that's straight-up damnation.
[Mosiah 16:12] They ran wild chasing their own carnal cravings, never hitting up the Lord even when mercy was reaching out, low-key ghosting the warnings about their sins, refusing to bounce from them or hit that repentance button when called.
[Mosiah 16:13] So, shouldn't y'all be shaking, dropping those sins, and remembering that being saved is a no-cap deal only through Christ?
[Mosiah 16:14] So if you're schooling folks on Moses' law, say less...make sure they know it's just a shadow flex of what's coming next.
[Mosiah 16:15] Teach 'em straight up: redemption drops only through Christ the Lord, who's low-key the Eternal Father himself. Amen.
[Mosiah 17:1] So after Abinadi dropped those bars, the king flexed hard and told the priests to snatch him and make sure he got iced.
[Mosiah 17:2] But there was this dude Alma, a Nephi descendant, young and woke...he vibed with Abinadi's words, knowing the crew was sus, so he begged the king to chill and let Abinadi bounce in peace.
[Mosiah 17:3] But the king caught major rage, kicked Alma to the curb, and sent his servants on beast mode to off him.
[Mosiah 17:4] Alma dipped hard, went ghost so they couldn't catch him, and while laying low for days, he penned all the fire Abinadi had said.
[Mosiah 17:5] The king ordered his guards to squad up, snag Abinadi, bind him tight, and throw him in the slammer.
[Mosiah 17:6] After three days, the king huddled with his priests and had Abinadi dragged back for another showdown.
[Mosiah 17:7] The king told him straight up: Abinadi, we got receipts on you, and you're definitely due for the death penalty.
[Mosiah 17:8] You said God himself would drop in with humans; now, unless you cancel those shady claims against me and my crew, you're headed for death.
[Mosiah 17:9] Abinadi clapped back: Nah, I'm not deleting my words about your squad 'cause they're facts. If you need proof, I'm here, caught up in your grip, no cap.
[Mosiah 17:10] For real, I'll take the L all the way to death, won't backtrack my words...they'll be receipts against you. Kill me, and you're guilty of innocent blood, which will roast you on Judgment Day, no cap.
[Mosiah 17:11] King Noah was lowkey about to free him 'cause he feared Abinadi's rizz and was sweating God's wrath sliding his way.
[Mosiah 17:12] But the priests threw major shade, yelling he dissed the king, so Noah caught big mad and handed him over to get clapped.
[Mosiah 17:13] They snatched him, tied him up, and flogged his skin with sticks so raw it led straight to death, no cap.
[Mosiah 17:14] When the fire started burning him up, he yelled out to them, saying:
[Mosiah 17:15] Yo, just like you're doing this to me, your squad's gonna make lots catch these same fire pains...death by flames...all 'cause they believe in the Lord's salvation.
[Mosiah 17:16] Bet, y'all gonna catch every kind of sickness 'cause you're mad guilty of sinning.
[Mosiah 17:17] For real, you'll get hit from all sides and be tossed around like wild sheep chased by savage predators.
[Mosiah 17:18] On that day, you'll get hunted down, caught by your enemies' hands, and go through the same fire death pain I'm facing, no cap.
[Mosiah 17:19] That's how God serves payback to anyone wrecking His people. Yo God, take my soul, I'm out.
[Mosiah 17:20] So, after dropping those bars, Abinadi went down, legit burned to death for not capping on God's commands, sealing his truth with his own sacrifice.
[Mosiah 18:1] So, Alma dipped from King Noah's crew, got real about his sins, and lowkey started preaching Abinadi's vibes to the people.
[Mosiah 18:2] He was all about the future stuff...resurrection, people getting saved...coming thru Christ's power, struggles, death, and then His bounce back and glow-up into heaven.
[Mosiah 18:3] Alma schooled anyone down to listen, kept it on the low so King Noah wouldn't catch wind, and a bunch actually bought into his message.
[Mosiah 18:4] So, everyone vibing with him rolled out to a spot called Mormon...named by the king...on the edge of the land where wild beasts popped up every now and then.
[Mosiah 18:5] In Mormon, there was a fresh AF water source, and Alma bounced there, hiding by some small trees during the day to dodge the king's squad looking for him.
[Mosiah 18:6] And for real, all who trusted him showed up there just to catch his word.
[Mosiah 18:7] After a hot minute, a solid crew gathered at Mormon to catch Alma's teaching...everyone who bought his message showed, and he schooled them on repentance, redemption, and trusting the Lord, no cap.
[Mosiah 18:8] Then Alma was like, "Yo, here's the waters of Mormon, and if y'all wanna join God's squad and rep His people, plus vibe by carrying each other's weight to keep it easy," say less.
[Mosiah 18:9] Bet you gotta vibe with those who're down, lift up the ones needing support, flex as God's witnesses all day, anywhere, even till death...so you get that first resurrection clout and eternal life, no cap.
[Mosiah 18:10] Honestly, if you're down for this in your heart, what's the tea on getting baptized in the Lord's name as a flex proving you're in a real covenant to serve Him and keep His commandments, so He can bless you with mad Spirit energy?
[Mosiah 18:11] When the crew heard this, they straight-up clapped hyped and said, "Yup, this is exactly what our hearts been wanting."
[Mosiah 18:12] So Alma grabbed Helam, one of the OG believers, stepped into the water, and flexed like, "Yo Lord, bless your servant with mad Spirit vibes so he can handle this holy work right."
[Mosiah 18:13] After that, the Lord's Spirit hit him hard, and Alma said, "Helam, I baptize you with God's full power as proof you're locked into serving Him till death, and may His Spirit flood you and bless you with eternal life through Christ, who's been ready since day one."
[Mosiah 18:14] After Alma spoke, both he and Helam dipped underwater, then popped up hyped and glowing, full of the Spirit's energy.
[Mosiah 18:15] Alma then grabbed another homie, stepped back into the water, baptized them just like before...but this time, he stayed above water, no dunk.
[Mosiah 18:16] Alma kept baptizing everyone rolling up to Mormon...around 204 peeps...and they all got dunked in Mormon's waters, loaded up with God's grace.
[Mosiah 18:17] From then on, they were known as the church of God, or the church of Christ; and anyone baptized with God's legit power got added to the squad.
[Mosiah 18:18] So Alma, packing God's full authority, appointed priests...like one priest per fifty peeps...to preach and school them on all things kingdom of God.
[Mosiah 18:19] He straight-up told them to only teach the stuff he taught, and the words dropped by the holy prophets...no cap, no extras.
[Mosiah 18:20] He made it clear: their preach game had to be all about repentance and faith in the Lord who saved His people...nothing else allowed, say less.
[Mosiah 18:21] He ordered no drama between them, telling them to vibe with one eye forward, sharing one faith and one baptism, hearts tight-knit in unity and mad love for each other.
[Mosiah 18:22] That's how he told them to preach, and by following that, they leveled up to become God's own children.
[Mosiah 18:23] He told them to keep the Sabbath holy, no slacking, and every day they had to hit God up with gratitude...daily thank-ups, no excuses.
[Mosiah 18:24] He also told the priests he appointed to hustle with their own hands to earn their keep...no freeloading allowed.
[Mosiah 18:25] Every week, they had to block out one day to squad up, teach the crew, worship God, and link up as much as they could...no cap.
[Mosiah 18:26] Priests couldn't mooch off the people; they earned God's grace through their grind, leveling up in Spirit and knowledge to teach with real power and God's authority.
[Mosiah 18:27] Alma told the church squad to share their stuff based on what they had...got more? Give more. Got less? Give less. No cap, if you got nothing, you get helped.
[Mosiah 18:28] They had to share their stuff willingly, straight from the heart for God, helping needy priests and every soul out there needing a hookup.
[Mosiah 18:29] He dropped this command straight from God, and they kept it 100, sharing with each other both the material and spiritual stuff based on what everyone needed and wanted.
[Mosiah 18:30] So, all this went down at Mormon...by the waters, in the forest near them...straight-up beautiful spot for anyone who got woke about their Redeemer; blessed AF, ready to praise Him forever.
[Mosiah 18:31] They pulled all this off on the edge of the land to keep it lowkey and avoid catching the king's attention.
[Mosiah 18:32] But no cap, the king caught wind of their vibe, sent his crew to spy, and boom...they got caught gathering to hear God's word.
[Mosiah 18:33] Now the king claimed Alma was flexing rebellion vibes, so he sent his army to clap back and wipe them out.
[Mosiah 18:34] Alma and the Lord's crew got the tea on the king's army rolling up, so they packed their tents and fam and dipped into the wilderness, no cap.
[Mosiah 18:35] They rolled deep...about 450 souls strong, no cap.
[Mosiah 19:1] The king's army came back empty-handed, totally ghosted on finding the Lord's crew.
[Mosiah 19:2] So, the king's squad got mad thinned out, and the leftover crew started catching major division vibes.
[Mosiah 19:3] The smaller group started throwing shade and threats at the king, sparking mad beef and chaos among them.
[Mosiah 19:4] There was this dude Gideon, he was a beast and straight-up hated the king, so he grabbed his sword and swore on his wrath he'd take the king out, no cap.
[Mosiah 19:5] Gideon threw hands with the king, but when the king realized he was about to get clapped, he dipped and booked it up the tower by the temple.
[Mosiah 19:6] Gideon chased him hard, almost caught him on the tower to end the king, but the king peeped the land of Shemlon and spotted the Lamanite army rolling into the area.
[Mosiah 19:7] The king screamed in pure panic, "Gideon, chill! The Lamanites are sliding on us, and they're gonna wreck everything...like, my whole squad's toast."
[Mosiah 19:8] TBH, the king cared more about saving his own skin than his people, but Gideon still chose to spare him anyway.
[Mosiah 19:9] The king told his squad to bounce from the Lamanites, led the way himself, and they dipped into the wilderness with their women and kids in tow.
[Mosiah 19:10] The Lamanites chased down the crew, caught up with them, and started straight-up slaughtering them.
[Mosiah 19:11] The king ordered all the men to ditch their wives and kids and just bounce from the Lamanites, no cap.
[Mosiah 19:12] A bunch refused to ghost their fam and chose to ride or die with them, while the others dipped, leaving wives and kids behind.
[Mosiah 19:13] Those who stayed with their fam had their gorgeous daughters step up and beg the Lamanites to spare their lives, saying, "Don't kill us, please."
[Mosiah 19:14] The Lamanites low-key felt bad and got soft because the women's beauty hit different and totally charmed them.
[Mosiah 19:15] So the Lamanites spared them, took them captive to Nephi, and said, "You can keep the land if you hand over King Noah, plus half your stuff...gold, silver, all the bling...and pay tribute every year to our king."
[Mosiah 19:16] Among the captives was the king's son, Limhi, holding main-character energy despite the whole mess.
[Mosiah 19:17] Limhi low-key hoped his dad wouldn't get wiped out, but he wasn't blind to his dad's shady moves...Limhi was straight-up a just dude.
[Mosiah 19:18] Gideon low-key sent some folks on a sneaky wilderness mission to find the king and his crew; they found everyone except the king and his priests.
[Mosiah 19:19] They promised in their hearts they'd bounce back to Nephi, and if their wives, kids, or ride-or-die crew got snatched, they'd hunt revenge and ride or die right with them.
[Mosiah 19:20] The king told them to chill and not come back, but they got mad, flipped him, and roasted him alive...no cap, full-on fire.
[Mosiah 19:21] They were ready to smoke the priests too, but those clout chasers dipped fast before they could be caught.
[Mosiah 19:22] When they were about to head back to Nephi, they ran into Gideon's squad who spilled the tea: their wives and kids were alive, and the Lamanites let them keep the land as long as they pay half their stuff as tribute.
[Mosiah 19:23] The people told Gideon's crew they'd offed the king, and the priests ghosted deeper into the wilderness to avoid the heat.
[Mosiah 19:24] After wrapping up the ceremony, they bounced back to Nephi hyped AF 'cause their wives and kids were safe, and they spilled to Gideon how they iced the king.
[Mosiah 19:25] The Lamanite king swore on his crown that his squad wouldn't off them...no cap.
[Mosiah 19:26] Limhi, the king's son and new boss by popular vote, swore to the Lamanite king that his people would pay up half their stuff as tribute...say less.
[Mosiah 19:27] Limhi started flexing his king moves, setting up the kingdom and bringing peace to his crew...big brain energy.
[Mosiah 19:28] The Lamanite king posted guards all around Limhi's turf to keep his people from ghosting into the wilderness, paying his guards with the tribute the Nephites threw his way.
[Mosiah 19:29] King Limhi's kingdom vibed with nonstop peace for two years straight...Lamanites kept it low-key and didn't come for them.
[Mosiah 20:1] In Shemlon, Lamanite girls pulled up to sing, dance, and just vibe hard together, no cap.
[Mosiah 20:2] One day, a small crew of them linked up to sing and dance, keeping the mood alive.
[Mosiah 20:3] King Noah's priests were hella sus about heading back to Nephi...low-key ashamed and scared the people would straight-up cap them...so they ghosted their own wives and kids instead.
[Mosiah 20:4] While chilling in the wilderness, they spotted the Lamanite daughters and low-key started creeping on them, no chill.
[Mosiah 20:5] When just a small squad showed up to dance, these creeps jumped out from hiding, snatched 24 Lamanite daughters, and hauled them off into the wilderness...straight disrespect.
[Mosiah 20:6] When the Lamanites noticed their daughters ghosted, they got mad at Limhi's crew, thinking they were the real ones who snatched them.
[Mosiah 20:7] So the Lamanite army rolled out, king leading the charge himself, heading to Nephi ready to wreck Limhi's squad.
[Mosiah 20:8] Limhi spotted their whole war prep from the tower, so he squad-upped and set up ambushes in the fields and woods, ready to clap back.
[Mosiah 20:9] When the Lamanites rolled up, Limhi's crew popped out from hiding, jumping on them and straight-up slaying the invaders.
[Mosiah 20:10] The fight got mad intense...they clapped back like lions hunting their meal, no cap.
[Mosiah 20:11] Limhi's squad started pushing the Lamanites back...even though they were way outnumbered...but they fought savage for their lives, fam, wives, and kids, flexin' hard like dragons on beast mode.
[Mosiah 20:12] They found the Lamanite king down with the dead, but he wasn't dead...just busted and left behind 'cause his crew bounced too quick.
[Mosiah 20:13] They patched up his wounds, dragged him to Limhi, and were like, "Yo, here's the Lamanite king, all hurt and ditched by his squad...now let's end him."
[Mosiah 20:14] Limhi said, "Don't kill him, bring him here so I can see." When he arrived, Limhi asked, "What's your beef going to war on my people? My squad kept the promise I made, so why you breaking yours?"
[Mosiah 20:15] The king clapped back, "I broke the oath 'cause your people snatched my daughters, so I got heated and sent my crew to war against yours."
[Mosiah 20:16] Limhi was shook, had no clue about this drama, so he said, "I'm gonna hunt down whoever did this, and they're donezo." He started searching his whole squad.
[Mosiah 20:17] Gideon, the king's captain, heard all this and said, "Hold up, boss, don't blame your people or start searching 'em just yet, chill."
[Mosiah 20:18] He was like, "Don't you remember your dad's priests? Your people tried to yeet them, and now they're hiding in the wilderness...low-key, they're the ones who jacked the Lamanite daughters."
[Mosiah 20:19] So, go tell the king this word so he can chill his crew towards us...'cause they're already gearing up to roll on us, and TBH, we're majorly outnumbered.
[Mosiah 20:20] Yo, their massive army's coming, and unless the king vibes with them to chill, we're straight-up doomed.
[Mosiah 20:21] Like, Abinadi's prophecy is hitting different...it's all coming true since we ghosted God's words and kept flexing our sins.
[Mosiah 20:22] So, let's chill the king and keep our promise to him...being slaves beats getting yeeted; time to cut the bloodshed, no cap.
[Mosiah 20:23] Limhi spilled all the tea to the king about his dad's priests hiding in the wilderness and low-key blamed them for snatching the daughters.
[Mosiah 20:24] The king chilled out towards his crew and said, "Let's roll out to meet my people unarmed, and I promise on my honor, no cap, my people won't kill yours."
[Mosiah 20:25] They flexed follow the king, rolling unarmed to meet the Lamanites; when they linked up, the Lamanite king bowed low and begged for Limhi's people's sake.
[Mosiah 20:26] Seeing Limhi's squad unarmed, the Lamanites caught feelings, chilled out, and peace'd back home with their king...no beef.
[Mosiah 21:1] Limhi and his crew bounced back to Nephi city and vibed in the land, living peaceful again.
[Mosiah 21:2] After a minute, the Lamanites got heated again at the Nephites and started rolling up on the borders like they weren't playing.
[Mosiah 21:3] They dared not kill them 'cause of the king's oath to Limhi, but they slapped cheeks, flexed power, and loaded heavy burdens on their backs, bossing them like dumb donkeys.
[Mosiah 21:4] For real, all this drama went down so God's word would get checked off.
[Mosiah 21:5] The Nephites were mad stressed with no way out since the Lamanites had them totally boxed in, no cap.
[Mosiah 21:6] The people started side-eyeing the king 'cause of all the beef and got hyped to throw down; they bugged him hard with complaints, so he finally said, "Bet, go do your thing."
[Mosiah 21:7] They squad up, gear up in armor, and roll out to beat the Lamanites off their turf.
[Mosiah 21:8] But the Lamanites clapped back, pushing them back and taking out mad of their people.
[Mosiah 21:9] Big vibes of mourning hit Limhi's people...widows crying for their husbands, kids for their dads, and bros for their brothers.
[Mosiah 21:10] Tons of widows were straight-up bawling daily, shook to their core 'cause the Lamanites had everyone low-key terrified.
[Mosiah 21:11] Their nonstop wails fired up Limhi's crew mad salty at the Lamanites; they tried to clap back but got dunked on hard with big losses.
[Mosiah 21:12] For real, they tried a third round and got wrecked the same way; the survivors just bounced back to the city of Nephi.
[Mosiah 21:13] They went full humble mode, grinding under bondage's yoke, taking beats, being pushed around, and loaded with stress...all 'cause their enemies wanted it that way.
[Mosiah 21:14] They hit peak humility vibes, crying out to God non-stop all day, begging Him to snatch them out of their mess.
[Mosiah 21:15] God was kinda slow to catch their prayers 'cause of their mess-ups, but still heard 'em and started tweaking the Lamanites' hearts to chill on the oppression; still, He didn't pull them straight out of bondage yet.
[Mosiah 21:16] Slowly but surely, they started leveling up...growing more grain and stacking flocks and herds, so hunger wasn't even in their vocabulary anymore.
[Mosiah 21:17] There were way more women than men, so King Limhi said every dude had to chip in for the widows and kids to keep them from starving, and they all did 'cause too many had already died.
[Mosiah 21:18] Limhi's squad stuck tight as possible and locked down their grain and flocks like pros.
[Mosiah 21:19] King Limhi wasn't about to dip outside the city walls solo...always rolled with his guards, mad scared of ending up Lamanite receipts.
[Mosiah 21:20] He had his squad on lookout 24/7, hoping to catch those runaway priests in the wilderness who jacked the Lamanite daughters and wrecked mad havoc on them.
[Mosiah 21:21] They legit wanted to snatch those priests to clap back, since they snuck into Nephi at night, stole grain and mad valuable stuff; so yeah, they set traps for them.
[Mosiah 21:22] After that, peace low-key held between the Lamanites and Limhi's crew...no beef...right up until Ammon and his bros rolled in.
[Mosiah 21:23] King Limhi was outside the city with his guards when he spotted Ammon and his bros, thought they were Noah's priests, so he had them cuffed and thrown in jail...if they actually were those priests, he'd have straight-up offed them.
[Mosiah 21:24] But then he realized they weren't Noah's crew...they were his own brothers from Zarahemla, and his joy hit max levels, no cap.
[Mosiah 21:25] Before Ammon showed up, King Limhi had already sent a few guys on a Zarahemla search mission...but they got straight lost in the wilderness, no receipts.
[Mosiah 21:26] Still, they found a place full of dry bones...once lived-in but wrecked...and thinking it was Zarahemla, they bounced back to Nephi's borders just before Ammon rolled up.
[Mosiah 21:27] They came back carrying receipts...a record of the crew whose bones they found...etched on some metal plates.
[Mosiah 21:28] Limhi got hype hearing from Ammon that King Mosiah had God's gifted rizz to decode those engravings; Ammon was vibing hard too.
[Mosiah 21:29] Still, Ammon and his squad were lowkey broken 'cause too many of their peeps got clapped.
[Mosiah 21:30] Plus, Ammon's crew was mad sad that King Noah and his priests led folks into hella sins against God, mourning Abinadi's death and Alma's bounce with his squad who built God's church strong AF on faith and Abinadi's words.
[Mosiah 21:31] Yeah, they were low-key bummed about Alma's crew ghosting since no one knew where they dipped to; they'd def been down to join since they'd already signed up to serve God and stick to His rules.
[Mosiah 21:32] Since Ammon showed up, King Limhi and his squad also made that covenant glow-up, pledging to serve God and follow His commandments, no cap.
[Mosiah 21:33] So King Limhi and his crew wanted to get baptized bad, but no one had the legit God-given clout to do it. Ammon bowed out, thinking he wasn't worthy enough to flex that.
[Mosiah 21:34] So, they held off making a church, waiting on the Lord's Spirit to slide in; low-key they wanted to be like Alma and his squad who dipped into the wilderness.
[Mosiah 21:35] They were shook to get baptized as proof they were all-in on serving God, but they postponed it for now...details on that glow-up coming soon.
[Mosiah 21:36] Ammon, Limhi, and their crews were grinding hard, focused on breaking free from Lamanite clutches and ditching that bondage for good.
[Mosiah 22:1] So Ammon and King Limhi started plotting with the squad on how to break outta bondage, making sure everyone pulled up to get their say...say less, democracy vibes.
[Mosiah 22:2] They realized their only move was to pack up women, kids, animals, and tents and bounce to the wilderness since the Lamanite squad was mad big...fighting them straight-up was just sus and impossible.
[Mosiah 22:3] Then Gideon rolled up to the king and was like, "Yo king, you've lowkey vibed with my advice plenty times when we've been beefing with the Lamanites."
[Mosiah 22:4] So king, if I haven't been a deadweight and my advice ever gave you receipts, hear me now...I'm down to serve and free this crew from bondage, say less.
[Mosiah 22:5] The king gave Gideon the mic, and he started spitting game:
[Mosiah 22:6] Peep the back door, behind the city wall...Lamanite guards get mad drunk at night. So, let's drop the word for everyone to squad up, grab their flocks and herds, and ghost into the wilderness under cover of darkness.
[Mosiah 22:7] I'll roll on your orders, serve the final wine tribute to the Lamanites to get them wasted, then we slide through the secret left-side pass while they're passed out.
[Mosiah 22:8] That way, we dip with our women, kids, flocks, and herds into the wilderness, cruising around Shilom's territory.
[Mosiah 22:9] The king straight-up listened to Gideon's plan, no cap.
[Mosiah 22:10] King Limhi got his people to squad up their flocks, sent the wine tribute plus extra as a gift to the Lamanites, who then drank it up mad freely.
[Mosiah 22:11] So Limhi's crew dipped at night with their flocks and herds, circled Shilom's land in the wild, and cruised toward Zarahemla, with Ammon and his crew leading the way.
[Mosiah 22:12] They packed all their gold, silver, valuable stuff they could lug, plus supplies, and kept flexing through the wilderness.
[Mosiah 22:13] After chilling in the wilderness for days, they pulled up in Zarahemla, linked up with Mosiah's squad, and went full-on subjects.
[Mosiah 22:14] Mosiah rolled out the red carpet, hyped to get them and their records...plus the ones Limhi's people had found.
[Mosiah 22:15] So when the Lamanites caught that Limhi's squad dipped overnight, they sent an army chasing after them in the wilderness.
[Mosiah 22:16] After grinding for two days tracking them, the Lamanites lost the scent and got straight-up lost in the wilderness.
[Mosiah 23:1] Alma got the heads-up from God that king Noah's armies were rolling up, so he told his people, they grabbed their flocks and grain, and dipped into the wilderness ahead of the squad.
[Mosiah 23:2] God boosted their vibe so hard that king Noah's people couldn't catch or cap their crew.
[Mosiah 23:3] They bounced deep...eight days straight...into the wilderness, no chill.
[Mosiah 23:4] They pulled up to a land that was straight-up gorgeous and chill, stocked with pure water vibes.
[Mosiah 23:5] They set up camp, started farming, and flexed on building...low-key grinding hard and putting in mad work.
[Mosiah 23:6] The people were all about making Alma their king since he was hella loved by the squad.
[Mosiah 23:7] Alma said, "Nah fam, having a king ain't the move...God says don't put one person above another or flex superiority, so no kings for us."
[Mosiah 23:8] But he low-key added, if you could always score righteous kings, then yeah, rocking a king would be clutch.
[Mosiah 23:9] Just remember how sus king Noah and his priests were; I got caught up too and did mad wrong stuff that made God hella mad, leaving me with serious regret.
[Mosiah 23:10] But after hella struggles, God heard my SOS, answered my prayers, and now I'm His plug, helping y'all get woke to His truth.
[Mosiah 23:11] Still, I ain't flexing on this, 'cause I'm low-key not worthy to brag about myself.
[Mosiah 23:12] So here's the tea: king Noah and his priests straight-up oppressed y'all, kept you shackled in sin, and got you tangled in mad guilt.
[Mosiah 23:13] Now that God powered y'all up and broke those chains...escaping king Noah and his crew plus that sin trap...I want y'all to hold tight to this freedom and low-key avoid trusting any king over you.
[Mosiah 23:14] Also, don't put your trust in any teacher or minister unless they're a real one...walking with God and sticking to His commandments, no cap.
[Mosiah 23:15] So Alma schooled his crew to love their neighbors like they love themselves...no cap, no beef allowed.
[Mosiah 23:16] Now Alma was their high priest, the OG who started their whole church vibe.
[Mosiah 23:17] No one got the green light to preach or teach without Alma's God-given okay; he blessed all their priests and teachers, but only the righteous got that consecration.
[Mosiah 23:18] So they kept an eye on their squad and fed them straight-up goodness and righteousness vibes.
[Mosiah 23:19] Soon enough, they started thriving big time in the land and named that spot Helam, no cap.
[Mosiah 23:20] They blew up in numbers and flexed major in Helam, even built a city and called it the city of Helam, say less.
[Mosiah 23:21] Still, the Lord's gotta test His people, flexing their patience and faith like a true vibe check.
[Mosiah 23:22] But real talk: whoever trusts Him gets majorly boosted on the last day, and that's exactly what went down with this crew.
[Mosiah 23:23] Watch this...these folks got locked down tight, and only the Lord, their God, like the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, could break them out.
[Mosiah 23:24] Then He pulled through and freed them, flexing His mad power, and they got hype with serious joy.
[Mosiah 23:25] So while they were grinding in Helam...yeah, in the city...working the fields, an army of Lamanites pulled up at the land's edge, no cap.
[Mosiah 23:26] When the Lamanites showed up, Alma's crew dipped from the fields and squad-assembled in Helam city, all shook from the Lamanites' whole vibe.
[Mosiah 23:27] Alma stepped up, told them to chill...don't let fear run that show...and said, remember God's got their backs and will save them, no cap.
[Mosiah 23:28] So they cut the panic, started praying hard that God would soften those Lamanite hearts to spare them, their wives, and kids...big prayer energy.
[Mosiah 23:29] God softened the Lamanites' hearts, so Alma and his squad rolled up and gave themselves up, letting the Lamanites take over Helam's turf, no cap.
[Mosiah 23:30] Meanwhile, the Lamanite armies chasing King Limhi's crew got mad lost in the wilderness for days straight, straight-up wandering.
[Mosiah 23:31] Lowkey, they tracked down King Noah's priests chilling in Amulon, took over the land, and started grinding the fields there like it's their new spot.
[Mosiah 23:32] The head priest running the show was Amulon...no cap, dude named the place after himself.
[Mosiah 23:33] So Amulon begged the Lamanites and sent their wives...who were actually Lamanite daughters...to hit up their bros for mercy, saying don't end their husbands, say less.
[Mosiah 23:34] The Lamanites caught feels for Amulon and his crew and spared them, all 'cause of those wives holding it down.
[Mosiah 23:35] Amulon and his squad linked up with the Lamanites, roaming the wilderness hunting for Nephi, but instead stumbled on Helam, where Alma and his crew were holding it down.
[Mosiah 23:36] The Lamanites told Alma and his crew that if they guided them to Nephi, they'd let them live free...no cap, that was the deal.
[Mosiah 23:37] But once Alma flexed the path to Nephi, the Lamanites ghosted on their promise and threw guards all around Helam, basically putting Alma and his crew on lockdown.
[Mosiah 23:38] Most of them bounced to Nephi, but some came back to Helam, bringing along the wives and kids of the guards they left behind...family reunion vibes, but sus.
[Mosiah 23:39] The Lamanite king made Amulon king over the Helam crew, but lowkey he had zero flex to do anything against the Lamanite king's vibe.
[Mosiah 24:1] Amulon got mad clout with the Lamanite king, so the king hooked him and his crew up as teachers over his people...even in Shemlon, Shilom, and Amulon...straight boss moves.
[Mosiah 24:2] Since the Lamanites had all these lands on lock, their king went ahead and crowned kings over each spot…standard power play.
[Mosiah 24:3] The Lamanite king flexed the name Laman, repping his pops, so everyone called him King Laman...and yeah, his squad was huge.
[Mosiah 24:4] He put Amulon's crew as teachers in every land his people owned, so Nephi's language started popping off all across the Lamanite squad.
[Mosiah 24:5] They were chill with each other, but lowkey clueless about God; Amulon's bros didn't drop any knowledge about the Lord, Moses' law, or Abinadi's words...big L for spiritual receipts.
[Mosiah 24:6] Instead, they taught them to keep receipts and slide into each other's DMs with written messages...communication game strong, but God knowledge? Nah.
[Mosiah 24:7] So the Lamanites started stacking riches, trading heavy, leveling up in worldly smarts, lowkey slick and crafty...but they kept their shady moves and loot to outsiders, not their own crew.
[Mosiah 24:8] Then Amulon started flexing power over Alma and his squad, throwing shade and making his kids drag down Alma's kids too...family beef on full blast.
[Mosiah 24:9] Amulon knew Alma was the king's priest who vibed with Abinadi's words and got booted by the king, so he was mad salty; even though he answered to King Laman, Amulon ran the show, bossing everyone with heavy tasks and taskmasters.
[Mosiah 24:10] Their struggles got so savage they started hitting God up with major prayer energy, no cap.
[Mosiah 24:11] Amulon straight up told them to zip it and posted guards to snatch anyone caught praying to God...death sentence, no chill.
[Mosiah 24:12] Alma and his crew kept it low-key, no loud prayers, just spilling their souls to God...He was fully tuned into their vibes.
[Mosiah 24:13] Then God slid into their struggle, saying, "Hold your heads high and chill...I see your promise to me, and I swear I got your back to break you outta this mess."
[Mosiah 24:14] I'll lighten your loads so much you won't even feel them while stuck in chains; I'm doing this so you can flex as my witnesses later and know for real that I, the Lord God, always check on my people when they're down.
[Mosiah 24:15] So the heavy loads on Alma and his crew got way lighter; God powered them up to handle it all smooth, and they vibed with His plan, patient and chill.
[Mosiah 24:16] Their faith and patience hit peak mode, so God came through again like, "Stay chill, tomorrow I'm freeing you from this mess."
[Mosiah 24:17] God told Alma, "You lead the squad, I'm rolling with you to break them outta chains."
[Mosiah 24:18] That night, Alma and his crew low-key rounded up their flocks and grain, grinding all night long without sleep.
[Mosiah 24:19] Next morning, God put the Lamanites and their taskmasters on some heavy, no-wake-up deep sleep vibes.
[Mosiah 24:20] Alma and his squad bounced into the wild, traveled the whole day, then set up camp in a valley they named Alma...shoutout to their main character leading the way.
[Mosiah 24:21] In Alma's valley, they hit God with mad gratitude for His mercy, for lifting their weight and breaking their chains...no one else could've pulled that off but the Lord, no cap.
[Mosiah 24:22] Everyone...men, women, and talkative kids...turned up to shout mad praise to God, no cap.
[Mosiah 24:23] God told Alma, "Move quick, dip with your crew from this spot 'cause the Lamanites woke up and chasing y'all; don't sweat it, I'll block them in this valley so they don't catch up."
[Mosiah 24:24] So they bounced from the valley and hit the wilderness for the next leg of their journey.
[Mosiah 24:25] After twelve days flexing in the wilderness, they rolled up to Zarahemla, and King Mosiah greeted them hyped and joyful.
[Mosiah 25:1] King Mosiah called a big meetup and got everyone gathered up, no cap.
[Mosiah 25:2] Low-key, the kids and fam of Nephi were fewer in number compared to the Zarahemla squad...Mulek's crew and their wilderness ride-or-die peeps.
[Mosiah 25:3] Neither the Nephi crew nor the Zarahemla gang came close to matching the Lamanites' numbers; they weren't even half the size, fr.
[Mosiah 25:4] So the Nephi peeps rolled up as one squad, Zarahemla folks did the same, and they chilled as two big crews.
[Mosiah 25:5] Mosiah put on the big brain energy, read out loud to everyone the receipts from Zeniff's records...from when they dipped Zarahemla to when they made it back.
[Mosiah 25:6] He also flexed the story of Alma and his crew's struggles, straight from when they bounced Zarahemla till they came back, no cap.
[Mosiah 25:7] When Mosiah finished dropping those records, everyone chilling in the land was shook and low-key amazed.
[Mosiah 25:8] They were straight-up confused on what to feel, but seeing the homies freed from chains hit them with mad joy, no cap.
[Mosiah 25:9] But then thinking about their bros who got clapped by the Lamanites had them feeling deep sorrow, tears flowing real talk.
[Mosiah 25:10] Then remembering God's instant goodness and power saving Alma and his squad from Lamanite clutches and slavery, they went full volume giving God mad props.
[Mosiah 25:11] Thinking about the Lamanite fam, their sinful vibes hit them hard with pain and mad anguish, all worried 'bout their souls' glow-up.
[Mosiah 25:12] So, Amulon's kids and his bros' crew, who married Lamanite daughters, got mad at their dads' sketchy moves and dipped from their names, repping Nephi instead to flex as Nephites.
[Mosiah 25:13] Now, the whole Zarahemla squad got counted as Nephites since the kingdom was legit only for Nephi's descendants, no cap.
[Mosiah 25:14] After Mosiah finished his speech and reading, he was like, "Alma, your turn to talk to the crew."
[Mosiah 25:15] Alma came through, hitting up big crowds, bouncing from group to group, hyping up repentance and faith in the Lord...say less.
[Mosiah 25:16] He straight-up told Limhi's crew and all the freed folks to never forget it was the Lord who pulled them outta bondage, no cap.
[Mosiah 25:17] After Alma dropped mad knowledge and wrapped up, King Limhi was hyped to get baptized, and his whole squad was on board too.
[Mosiah 25:18] So Alma dipped into the water and baptized them just like he did with his bros at Mormon's spot; all who got baptized joined God's church 'cause they vibed with Alma's words.
[Mosiah 25:19] King Mosiah gave Alma the green light to set up churches all over Zarahemla and flexed him with the power to appoint priests and teachers for each squad.
[Mosiah 25:20] This was 'cause the crowd was massive...no way one teacher could handle all of 'em or fit God's word into just one meetup.
[Mosiah 25:21] So they split into squads called churches, each with their own priests and teachers, all preaching straight from Alma's OG script.
[Mosiah 25:22] Even with all these separate churches, they were low-key one squad...the church of God...because the only drip they preached was repentance and faith in God.
[Mosiah 25:23] There were seven churches in Zarahemla, and anyone wanting to rock the name of Christ or God just slid into one of God's churches, no cap.
[Mosiah 25:24] They got dubbed the people of God, and the Lord dropped His Spirit on them...blessed up and thriving in the land, big W energy.
[Mosiah 26:1] So, the new gen wasn't really catching king Benjamin's words since they were just kids when he spoke, and they low-key doubted their parents' traditions.
[Mosiah 26:2] They straight-up doubted the resurrection hype and also weren't buying the whole Christ-coming storyline.
[Mosiah 26:3] Since they were so sus about faith, the word of God didn't land, and their hearts basically went full stone mode.
[Mosiah 26:4] They dipped on baptism and ghosted the church, staying a separate crew with sus faith, stuck in their messy sin vibes 'cause they refused to hit up the Lord their God.
[Mosiah 26:5] During Mosiah's reign, these haters weren't even half as many as God's people...but their beefs among themselves somehow made their numbers blow up.
[Mosiah 26:6] They low-key tricked church peeps with sweet talk, making them mess up big time, so it was only right for the church to call out the sinners in their squad.
[Mosiah 26:7] So, the teachers handed the troublemakers to the priests, who then showed up with them before Alma, the high priest big boss.
[Mosiah 26:8] King Mosiah straight-up gave Alma the full boss-level authority over the church.
[Mosiah 26:9] Alma was out the loop on this, but the receipts were stacked...tons of people came through with straight-up testimony on their shady moves.
[Mosiah 26:10] Nothing like this had ever gone down in the church before, so Alma was shook and made sure they got dragged in front of the king.
[Mosiah 26:11] Alma told the king, "Yo, here's a bunch of folks we brought who got called out by their crew for serious dirt, and they're not even sorry; so we need you to judge them based on their crimes."
[Mosiah 26:12] King Mosiah was like, "Nah, I'm not the judge here, so I'm handing them over to you, Alma, to handle their verdict."
[Mosiah 26:13] Alma was low-key stressed again and hit up the Lord for advice cuz he didn't wanna mess up and be sus in God's eyes.
[Mosiah 26:14] After Alma poured his whole heart out to God, the Lord hit him back with a voice saying:
[Mosiah 26:15] God said, "Alma, you're blessed, for real, and so are those baptized in Mormon's waters...you've got mad blessings 'cause you trusted straight-up the words of my dude Abinadi, no cap."
[Mosiah 26:16] Plus, mad blessings on those who flex serious faith just off the words you dropped on them, no receipts needed.
[Mosiah 26:17] You're blessed, Alma, 'cause you set up a church for these folks; they're gonna be solid and officially my crew.
[Mosiah 26:18] For real, big blessings on these peeps willing to rock my name; they'll be repping it and straight-up belong to me.
[Mosiah 26:19] You hit me up about the sinner, Alma, so you're blessed for keeping it right.
[Mosiah 26:20] You're my servant, Alma, and I'm making a promise...you'll get eternal life, serve me, rep my name, and round up my crew.
[Mosiah 26:21] Anyone tuning into my vibe is my sheep; y'all bring them into the church, and I'll welcome them too, no cap.
[Mosiah 26:22] Look, this is my church; anyone baptized is all about that repentance life. Whoever you welcome gonna believe in my name, and I'll straight-up forgive them, no questions.
[Mosiah 26:23] It's me who cops the world's sins, made everything, and gives a spot at my right hand to anyone who sticks with faith till the end, no cap.
[Mosiah 26:24] Peep this: they're repping my name, and if they know me, they'll roll up and snag a forever seat at my right hand.
[Mosiah 26:25] When the second trumpet drops, all those who ghosted on knowing me will show up and stand right in front of me, no cap.
[Mosiah 26:26] Then they'll peep that I'm the Lord their God and their Redeemer...but too bad, they chose not to get redeemed.
[Mosiah 26:27] Then I'll straight-up tell them I never knew them, and they'll bounce to eternal fire built for the devil and his squad.
[Mosiah 26:28] So listen up: if someone's ignoring my voice, don't let them into my church, 'cause I won't accept them on Judgment Day, no cap.
[Mosiah 26:29] So go, and judge anyone who messes with me based on their sins; if they confess to you and me and genuinely repent, y'all forgive 'em, and I'll back that up too.
[Mosiah 26:30] For real, no cap...whenever my people hit that repentance, I'm right here forgiving their slips against me, no limits.
[Mosiah 26:31] And y'all gotta forgive each other's mess-ups; for real, if someone claims they repented but can't forgive their neighbor, they're just digging their own grave, no cap.
[Mosiah 26:32] So here's the deal: go out, and anyone who won't repent ain't making the cut as my people...this rule's locked in from now on, no cap.
[Mosiah 26:33] When Alma caught these words, he scribbled them down to keep receipts and judge the church folks by God's commandments, say less.
[Mosiah 26:34] So Alma stepped up and judged the ones caught slippin' in sin, straight up following the Lord's word, no cap.
[Mosiah 26:35] Anyone who owned up and genuinely repented got added to the church squad, no doubt.
[Mosiah 26:36] But those who refused to confess and repent got straight-up erased from the church roster...no cap, their names got wiped.
[Mosiah 26:37] Alma took charge of the church biz; peace popped off, things started booming, folks kept it 100 with God, and they were pulling in and baptizing mad people.
[Mosiah 26:38] Alma and his crew ran the church grind hard, schooling everyone on God's word, dealing with all kinds of haters and drama from outsiders who weren't down with God's squad.
[Mosiah 26:39] They kept calling out their bros and got called out too, all by God's word based on their sins, grinding prayers nonstop and flexing gratitude no matter what.
[Mosiah 27:1] So the haters hit the church hard, people started low-key whining to their leaders, finally bringing the tea to Alma, who then put the case on the king's desk...Mosiah...and Mosiah checked in with his priests for the play.
[Mosiah 27:2] Then King Mosiah dropped an official notice all over the land: no unbeliever is allowed to come at anyone in God's church...end of story.
[Mosiah 27:3] The churches got a hard no on drama...no persecution allowed inside...and everyone had to keep it equal, no cap.
[Mosiah 27:4] No room for flexing or ego that messes with the vibe; everyone's gotta treat their neighbor like they treat themselves and grind with their own hands to keep things moving.
[Mosiah 27:5] Even priests and teachers had to hustle with their own hands for support...unless they were sick or seriously strapped...and by doing this, they were swimming in God's grace, no cap.
[Mosiah 27:6] Peace hit different again, the squad got huge, and folks started spreading out north, south, east, and west, building big cities and villages everywhere like it was their main gig.
[Mosiah 27:7] God pulled up on them, blessed the hustle, and boom...they turned into a massive, loaded crew.
[Mosiah 27:8] So, Mosiah's sons rolled with the unbelievers, including Alma's son...also named Alma...who was straight-up sus: wicked, idol-worshipping, and a smooth talker full of flattery that got a ton of people caught up in his bad vibes.
[Mosiah 27:9] He was a major L for God's church, snatching people's hearts, stirring mad drama, and giving God's enemy the perfect chance to flex on them.
[Mosiah 27:10] So, while he was low-key plotting to wreck God's church, rolling with Mosiah's sons, trying to mislead God's crew and break all the rules...God's and the king's...say less.
[Mosiah 27:11] Like I said, while they were out here rebelling against God, boom...a Lord's angel shows up, rolling in like a cloud, drops thunderous voice vibes that made the ground shake under their feet.
[Mosiah 27:12] They were shook to the max, dropped flat on the ground, and couldn't even catch what the angel was saying.
[Mosiah 27:13] But the angel shouted again, "Alma, get up and step up! Why you clowning on God's church? The Lord's said this is His crew and He's locking it down...only if His people mess up will it fall."
[Mosiah 27:14] Then the angel was like, "Yo, the Lord's been hearing the prayers of His people and your dad Alma, who prayed big faith for you to wake up to the truth; that's why I'm here...to show you God's power and authority so their prayers get that faith-backed W."
[Mosiah 27:15] So, can you really debate God's power? My voice made the earth shake, you see me right here, and I'm straight-up sent from God...say less.
[Mosiah 27:16] Listen up: remember your ancestors' captivity in Helam and Nephi, and all the epic stuff God did to free them from bondage. So, Alma, bounce from the church destruction game so their prayers get through, even if you end up getting benched solo.
[Mosiah 27:17] So, those were the angel's final words to Alma before bouncing.
[Mosiah 27:18] Alma and his crew dropped to the ground, shook beyond belief, 'cause they saw a legit angel of the Lord, whose thunder voice shook the earth...no cap, only God's power could flex like that and make the land wanna split.
[Mosiah 27:19] Alma was so shook he went mute, couldn't even move his hands, so his crew had to straight-up carry his helpless self back to his dad.
[Mosiah 27:20] They spilled all the tea to his dad about what went down, and he was hyped, knowing this was God's power for real.
[Mosiah 27:21] He pulled a big crowd to peep what the Lord had just done for his son and the squad with him...major vibe check.
[Mosiah 27:22] He got the priests to squad up, fast, and pray God would legit open Alma's mouth and power up his limbs, so everyone could catch the glow-up and glory of God.
[Mosiah 27:23] After grinding two days and nights of fasting and praying, Alma's limbs got their juice back, he stood up and started speaking, telling everyone to chill and stay hopeful.
[Mosiah 27:24] He said, "Yo, I've switched up, repented big time, and the Lord redeemed me...check it, I'm straight-up born of the Spirit now."
[Mosiah 27:25] The Lord told me: don't trip that everyone...men, women, every nation, tribe, language, and squad...needs to be born again, born of God, leveling up from their fallen vibes to righteous, redeemed, and rocking that son and daughter status.
[Mosiah 27:26] So yeah, they become whole new beings, and if they don't do that, no cap, they can't inherit God's kingdom.
[Mosiah 27:27] I'm telling y'all, if they don't change, they get the boot...trust me, I came that close to getting canceled myself.
[Mosiah 27:28] Even after swimming through mad troubles and nearly dying repenting, the Lord mercifully pulled me out of eternal fire, and now I'm born of God, no cap.
[Mosiah 27:29] My soul got rescued from bitter vibes and wicked chains; I was deep in the darkest pit, but now I'm catching God's epic light. Eternal torture had me shook, but now I'm saved and feeling no pain at all.
[Mosiah 27:30] I threw shade at my Redeemer and doubted our ancestors' talks, but now that they can see He's coming and remembers every single one He made, He's about to show up for everyone, no cap.
[Mosiah 27:31] For real, every knee's gonna buckle and every tongue gonna spill the tea before Him. On judgment day, everyone's gonna admit He's God, even those who ghosted Him...they'll know eternal punishment is fair, shaking and shrinking under His all-seeing stare.
[Mosiah 27:32] From then on, Alma started schooling the people, rolling with the crew who saw the angel, touring the land, spreading the receipts they'd seen and heard, preaching God's word through heavy hate and big-time persecution, getting knocked around by the unbelievers.
[Mosiah 27:33] Even with all that drama, they dropped mad comfort to the church, boosted their faith, and hustled patiently through the struggle, pushing everyone to stick to God's commandments.
[Mosiah 27:34] Four of them were Mosiah's sons...Ammon, Aaron, Omner, and Himni...that's the squad's lineup, no cap.
[Mosiah 27:35] They cruised all over Zarahemla, hitting every spot under King Mosiah's reign, grinding hard to fix the damage they did to the church, owning their sins, spilling the tea on what they saw, and breaking down prophecies and scriptures for anyone down to listen.
[Mosiah 27:36] So yeah, they were straight-up God's tools, pulling tons of people into the real deal and showing them who their Redeemer really is.
[Mosiah 27:37] Mad blessed are they! They dropped peace vibes, spread the hypest good news, and told everyone straight up that the Lord is running the show.
[Mosiah 28:1] After smashing all that work, Mosiah's sons grabbed a small crew, bounced back to their dad the king, and asked to roll up to Nephi's land to preach what they'd heard and drop God's word to their Lamanite fam.
[Mosiah 28:2] The goal? Pull them into knowing the Lord, expose their dads' sins, heal their hate for the Nephites, get them hyped about God, vibe-friendly with each other, and squash beef all over the land God gave them.
[Mosiah 28:3] They low-key wanted salvation to hit every single soul because the thought of anyone catching eternal L's and suffering forever legit made them freak out.
[Mosiah 28:4] The Spirit clapped back on them hard since they were the biggest sinners, but God, in His endless mercy, decided to spare them...still, they caught mad soul pain, stressed they might get ghosted forever.
[Mosiah 28:5] They kept hitting up their dad for days straight, begging to bounce to Nephi's land.
[Mosiah 28:6] King Mosiah slid into a convo with the Lord, asking if he should let his sons roll up to the Lamanites and preach the word.
[Mosiah 28:7] The Lord told Mosiah, "Let them roll, plenty will vibe with their message and snag eternal life, and I got your sons' backs...I'll rescue them from the Lamanites."
[Mosiah 28:8] So Mosiah gave the green light, letting them bounce and do their thing like they asked.
[Mosiah 28:9] They dipped into the wilderness, heading up to preach to the Lamanites; I'll spill the tea on what went down later.
[Mosiah 28:10] King Mosiah was stuck with no heir in sight 'cause none of his sons were down to claim the throne.
[Mosiah 28:11] So he grabbed the brass plates, the plates of Nephi, plus all the stuff he'd kept per God's orders, after translating and writing up the gold plates found by Limhi's crew and handed over by Limhi himself.
[Mosiah 28:12] He did all that 'cause his people were mad anxious, craving all the deets on the crew who got wiped out.
[Mosiah 28:13] He translated the records using those two stones clamped in the rims of a bow...say less, tech upgrade on ancient flex.
[Mosiah 28:14] These tools were OG made and passed down through the squad, all to flex on language barriers.
[Mosiah 28:15] The Lord's been low-key guarding these so anyone owning the land gets the receipts on their people's wickedness and mess-ups.
[Mosiah 28:16] Anyone holding these vibes gets the title "seer," straight up like the old-school legends.
[Mosiah 28:17] After Mosiah wrapped up translating, the records spilled the full story...from the wiped-out crew back to the big tower build when God confused their language and scattered them worldwide, going all the way back to Adam's creation.
[Mosiah 28:18] The story made Mosiah's people majorly sad, heartbroken no cap; but low-key, it dropped mad knowledge they actually vibed with.
[Mosiah 28:19] This story's gonna get penned soon 'cause, no cap, everyone needs the tea on what's in these pages.
[Mosiah 28:20] Like I said, after Mosiah finished up, he handed the brass plates, all his stash, plus the interpreters to Alma Jr., telling him to guard the records and keep logging the people's story, passing it down just like since Lehi dipped from Jerusalem.
[Mosiah 29:1] After wrapping up, Mosiah slid through the whole land asking the squad who they wanted as their next king...vibe check on the crown.
[Mosiah 29:2] The people hit back saying, "Yo, we want your son Aaron to be our king and boss."
[Mosiah 29:3] Aaron was out in Nephi, so Mosiah couldn't crown him; plus Aaron wasn't about that king life, and none of Mosiah's other sons wanted the throne either.
[Mosiah 29:4] So Mosiah slid another message to the people...this time a letter...with these exact words:
[Mosiah 29:5] Yo, my people, my fam, I see y'all like that, so peep this: think hard about why you're hyped to get a king.
[Mosiah 29:6] Just saying, the real heir to the throne dipped and ain't about taking the crown.
[Mosiah 29:7] If y'all pick someone else, I low-key fear it'll stir mad drama; and who knows, maybe my son, the true heir, gets salty, pulls a squad, sparks wars that'd spill blood, mess up God's path, and wreck souls.
[Mosiah 29:8] So listen up, let's get smart and think this through...we ain't got the right to cancel my son, nor anyone else if they get picked instead.
[Mosiah 29:9] If my son gets caught up in ego again, he'd flex his claim to the throne, dragging both him and the people into a ton of sin.
[Mosiah 29:10] So let's be smart, peep the future, and do what keeps the peace for everyone.
[Mosiah 29:11] Bet, I'll hold the king spot till I'm out, but we're setting up judges...wise peeps who'll run the show by God's rules and fix the squad's business right.
[Mosiah 29:12] Real talk, it's way better to get judged by God than by humans, 'cause God's verdicts are always fair, while humans can be straight up sus.
[Mosiah 29:13] So, if you could get legit kings who run God's laws and judge right like my dad Benjamin did, no cap, then having kings would be the move for real.
[Mosiah 29:14] I've been grinding hard with all I got to school you on God's commands and keep peace...no wars, no beef, no stealing, no killing, no bad vibes at all.
[Mosiah 29:15] Anyone who's pulled dirt got dealt with fair, based on the law our ancestors handed down...no exceptions, no cap.
[Mosiah 29:16] Look, since not everyone's righteous, having a king or kings running y'all isn't really the move right now.
[Mosiah 29:17] For real, one bad king can spark mad sin and bring major chaos...straight-up destruction vibes.
[Mosiah 29:18] Yo, remember King Noah's wild wickedness and his crew's messed-up ways...look at the huge wreckage that hit them and how their sins ended up slapping them into straight-up bondage.
[Mosiah 29:19] If their all-wise Creator hadn't stepped in 'cause they actually said sorry, they'd still be stuck in bondage no cap, till today.
[Mosiah 29:20] But check it, He pulled them out 'cause they got humble and yelled out to Him hard; that's how the Lord flexes, showing mad mercy to anyone who trusts Him.
[Mosiah 29:21] Real talk, you can't just kick out a wicked king without hella drama and mad bloodshed.
[Mosiah 29:22] See, that king's got his shady squad and bodyguards, tears up the old righteous laws, and straight-up stomps on God's commandments like they're nothing.
[Mosiah 29:23] That king drops laws twisted by his own evil vibe, and anyone who ain't with it gets wiped; rebels get armies thrown at them, risking total destruction...unrighteous kings flip all good into chaos.
[Mosiah 29:24] Yo, just saying, you don't want these nasty vibes crashing down on you; it ain't the move.
[Mosiah 29:25] So, pick judges from the people's shout, so y'all get judged by the legit laws our ancestors got straight from the Lord's own hand...no cap.
[Mosiah 29:26] Usually, the people don't vibe with stuff that's sus, but low-key the minority might want the wrong thing...so make this your rule: run things by the people's voice, no cap.
[Mosiah 29:27] But if the people ever go full wrong and pick sin, brace yourself...God's judgment drops hard, bringing destruction like you've never seen before.
[Mosiah 29:28] If your judges ain't judging by the law they've been given, you can flex and have them judged by someone higher up.
[Mosiah 29:29] If your top judges ain't keeping it 100, gather some lower judges to roast the higher-ups based on what the people want, no cap.
[Mosiah 29:30] I'm telling you, do this with mad respect for God...no kings allowed...so if people mess up, they gotta take the L themselves, no excuses.
[Mosiah 29:31] Real talk, a lot of people's sins come from their wicked kings, so those kings gotta catch the receipts and take the blame.
[Mosiah 29:32] Low-key, I want no more unfairness here, especially with my people; I want this place to be a land of freedom where everyone gets equal rights as long as the Lord lets us stay and our fam keeps reps on this earth.
[Mosiah 29:33] King Mosiah spilled all the tea on what it's like to be a good king...the struggles, soul pain for his people, and even their constant complaining...and laid it all out for them, say less.
[Mosiah 29:34] He said this stuff ain't how it should be ... the grind gotta be shared by everyone, so every dude pulls his weight.
[Mosiah 29:35] He also spelled out all the Ls they got stuck with when an unworthy king was running the show.
[Mosiah 29:36] For real, all his sins, disgusting moves, wars, fights, bloodshed, theft, robbery, cheating, and every wild sin you can't even list...he made clear none of that's chill or God-approved.
[Mosiah 29:37] After King Mosiah dropped all this knowledge, the people were low-key shook and fully convinced his words were straight facts.
[Mosiah 29:38] So, they said "nah" to wanting a king, got hyped for equal chances everywhere, and everyone was down to own up to their own sins, no blame-shifting allowed.
[Mosiah 29:39] So they squad up all over the land to vote on judges to keep it real with the law they got, and everyone was vibing hard with the freedom they just scored.
[Mosiah 29:40] They got mad love for Mosiah, ranking him higher than anyone else; no cap, they didn't see him as some greedy tyrant chasing cash that ruins souls...he didn't squeeze them for riches or vibe with bloodshed, but brought peace and freedom, so they stanned him big time.
[Mosiah 29:41] They set up judges everywhere to run things and judge by the law, making it official all across the land.
[Mosiah 29:42] Alma got the first chief judge drip, also rocking high priest vibes 'cause his dad handed him the role and the whole church biz responsibility.
[Mosiah 29:43] Alma flexed serious Lord-approved moves, kept the commandments tight, judged with straight-up fairness, and peace was on repeat everywhere.
[Mosiah 29:44] That's how the judge era kicked off in all Zarahemla with the Nephites, and Alma took the crown as the OG chief judge.
[Mosiah 29:45] Then his dad passed at 82, having lived that full-commandment life no cap.
[Mosiah 29:46] Mosiah then died at 63, after 33 years ruling, marking 509 years since Lehi bounced from Jerusalem...big timeline energy.
[Mosiah 29:47] That's a wrap on king reigns over the Nephites, and on Alma's days too...the OG church founder, no cap.
[Alma 1:1] So, year one of the judges era for the Nephites kicked off after King Mosiah dipped for good...he fought the good fight, stayed woke with God, left no heir, but had already dropped laws everyone was low-key forced to follow.
[Alma 1:2] First year Alma took the judge throne, a big dude known for mad strength rolled up for judgment.
[Alma 1:3] This guy was out here preaching his version of God's word, throwing shade at the church, saying priests and teachers should be clout-chasers, no work grind...just getting paid by the people.
[Alma 1:4] He hyped that everyone's gonna get saved on Judgment Day, no fear needed...just flex and celebrate...cause the Lord made and redeemed all, so eternal life's the endgame for everyone.
[Alma 1:5] He spammed those ideas hard, got mad followers who low-key stan'd him and started throwing cash his way.
[Alma 1:6] Dude got majorly full of himself, flexing in pricey fits, and even started his own church squad based on his hype preach.
[Alma 1:7] While preaching to his fans, he ran into a legit church teacher and threw serious shade trying to steal the crowd, but the teacher clapped back hard with God's receipts.
[Alma 1:8] The man was Gideon, God's go-to player who bossed up and freed Limhi's crew from chains.
[Alma 1:9] Gideon came through with God's word, but dude got salty, pulled a sword, and started smacking him down...Gideon was old AF and couldn't flex back, so he got taken out.
[Alma 1:10] The church crew caught the sword guy and dragged him to Alma's judgment seat to get roasted for his crimes.
[Alma 1:11] Dude faced Alma and flexed mad confidence trying to talk his way out.
[Alma 1:12] Alma clapped back: this priestcraft stunt is brand new here, and you're not just guilty...you tried to force it with a sword. If this cult vibe takes over, it's game over for everyone.
[Alma 1:13] You straight-up spilled the blood of a righteous dude, who did mad good for these people, and if we let you slide, his blood's gonna haunt us all for vengeance, no cap.
[Alma 1:14] So yeah, you're sentenced to die...Mosiah's law says so, and the squad's down with it, so we're sticking to the rules, no exceptions.
[Alma 1:15] They grabbed the guy, Nehor, hauled him up hill Manti, and there he low-key admitted his teachings were straight-up against God's word before catching a shameful death.
[Alma 1:16] But fr, priestcraft kept spreading 'cause lots were all about that fake flex, preaching lies just to stack cash and snag clout.
[Alma 1:17] Still, they didn't dare cap publicly 'cause the law's got receipts and punishes liars, so they acted like they truly believed their own fake sermons...law can't touch your beliefs, only your lies.
[Alma 1:18] And they didn't risk stealing or robbing 'cause the law's no joke...murder gets you the death penalty, so they kept it lowkey.
[Alma 1:19] But real talk, anyone outside God's crew started throwing shade and hate at those repping Christ and rocking that church badge.
[Alma 1:20] For real, they came at them with all kinds of verbal heat just 'cause these folks stayed humble, no ego flex, sharing God's word freely...no cap, no paywall.
[Alma 1:21] The church had a hard rule: no one in the squad was allowed to come for outsiders, and no drama or beef inside the crew either.
[Alma 1:22] Still, plenty in the crew got big-headed and started beefing hard with their haters, throwing hands and landing punches like it's a street fight.
[Alma 1:23] This all went down in Alma's second year on the throne and low-key wrecked the church's vibe, bringing mad pain and tests to the squad.
[Alma 1:24] Tons had their hearts iced over, got ghosted from God's squad list, and a bunch straight up dipped from the crew.
[Alma 1:25] For real, it was a huge test for the faithful, but they stayed solid, unshakable with God's rules, and took the hate thrown their way with mad patience.
[Alma 1:26] When priests paused their grind to drop God's word, the people bounced from their hustle to listen; once fed, everyone got back to work...no preacher flexing like they're better than the squad, teacher and learner on the same level, all grinding with their own hustle.
[Alma 1:27] Everyone chipped in what they had to help the poor, sick, and struggling; no flex on fancy clothes, but they kept it clean and fresh.
[Alma 1:28] So they got the church stuff tight again and vibes went steady peaceful, even with all the haters lurking.
[Alma 1:29] Since the church stayed solid, they got mad rich...stacks of flocks, herds, fat livestock, grain, gold, silver, jewels, plus silk and fresh linen on deck, all the cozy cloth they needed.
[Alma 1:30] Even with all the riches, they never bounced on anyone lacking clothes, food, or care, no cap on generosity...helping all, young or old, free or bound, guy or girl, church fam or not, no playin' favorites when it came to needs.
[Alma 1:31] That's how they thrived, stacking way more wealth than anyone outside their church crew, no cap.
[Alma 1:32] The outsiders dipped deep in sorcery, idol worship, lazy vibes, gossip, envy, and fighting; flexing pricey fits, high-key full of pride, throwing shade, lying, stealing, cheating, killing, straight-up wicked ... but the law clapped down on all sins whenever they could.
[Alma 1:33] So, with the law dropping receipts on everyone's bad moves, folks chilled out and didn't wanna catch wicked vibes publicly; peace was the main energy in Nephi till year five of the judges' run.
[Alma 2:1] At the jump of year five in their reign, drama popped off when Amlici, low-key a sly dude with worldly smarts, started beef; he rolled like the guy who clapped Gideon with the sword but got iced by the law.
[Alma 2:2] Amlici, flexing his sneaky moves, pulled a big crew with him, getting mad clout, and they started pushing to crown him king over everyone.
[Alma 2:3] The church crew and everyone not caught up in Amlici's rizz got hella shook, knowing their law said any king moves gotta get the people's say first.
[Alma 2:4] If Amlici somehow scored the people's vote, this sus dude planned to snatch their church rights and straight-up wreck God's church, no cap.
[Alma 2:5] So, everyone across the land split into squads...some riding with Amlici, others not...and big debates with mad drama popped off everywhere.
[Alma 2:6] They all came through to drop their votes on this hot mess, and the judges got the full rundown.
[Alma 2:7] The squad voted Amlici out...no crown for this guy, period.
[Alma 2:8] Those who clapped back on Amlici were vibing hard, but Amlici fired up his fans to throw shade and beef on the haters.
[Alma 2:9] They rolled deep, officially anointed Amlici as their king, no cap.
[Alma 2:10] Once king, Amlici bossed his crew to strap up and throw hands at their own fam, all to flex power and make them bow to him.
[Alma 2:11] Amlici's squad got labeled Amlicites, while everyone else kept the Nephites tag...the true people of God, no contest.
[Alma 2:12] Nephites caught the Amlicites' shady plans and got strapped AF with swords, scimitars, bows, arrows, rocks, slings...literally every weapon in the arsenal, ready to clap back.
[Alma 2:13] So the Nephites flexed readiness to face the Amlicites when they rolled up...lined up captains, big captains, and top captains matching their squad size, all set for the showdown.
[Alma 2:14] Amlici hooked his crew with every type of war gear and picked rulers and leaders to hype them up for beef against their own fam.
[Alma 2:15] The Amlicites showed up at Amnihu hill east of Sidon river by Zarahemla and kicked off war with the Nephites right there.
[Alma 2:16] Alma, top judge and governor of the Nephites, rolled up with his crew...captains and big bosses...leading the charge straight into battle against the Amlicites.
[Alma 2:17] They started popping Amlicites on the hill east of Sidon, but the Amlicites fought back mad hard, and not gonna lie, plenty Nephites got smoked.
[Alma 2:18] Still, the Lord boosted the Nephites' power so hard they slaughtered the Amlicites big time, making them dip and run for real.
[Alma 2:19] The Nephites chased the Amlicites all day, bodying them hard...12,532 Amlicites got taken down, while the Nephites lost 6,562 in the grind.
[Alma 2:20] When Alma couldn't chase the Amlicites no more, he told his squad to set up camp in Gideon valley...named after that Gideon dude who Nehor clocked with a sword...and the Nephites crashed there for the night.
[Alma 2:21] Alma slid spies on the Amlicite leftovers to peep their rizz and schemes, making sure he's one step ahead to keep his crew safe from getting wiped out.
[Alma 2:22] The squad Alma sent to scout the Amlicite camp? Zeram, Amnor, Manti, and Limher...with their crews...on full watch mode.
[Alma 2:23] Next day, they pulled up to the Nephite camp mad rushed, shook and shook, low-key scared, yelling:
[Alma 2:24] Yo, we tracked the Amlicite camp and no cap, up in Minon above Zarahemla in Nephi's turf, spotted a whole squad of Lamanites...the Amlicites linked up with them too.
[Alma 2:25] They're crashing our homies hard, who're hauling their flocks, wives, and kids running to our city; if we don't speed up, they'll snag our city and kill our dads, wives, and kids...big L incoming.
[Alma 2:26] So, the Nephites packed up their tents and bounced from Gideon valley straight back to their city, Zarahemla.
[Alma 2:27] As they crossed the Sidon River, the Lamanites and Amlicites rolled up in numbers almost like sea sand, ready to wreck them.
[Alma 2:28] Still, the Nephites got that holy boost 'cause they prayed hard, and God heard them, flexed on their enemies, making the Lamanites and Amlicites fold before them.
[Alma 2:29] Alma went sword-to-sword with Amlici, face-to-face, both throwing down hard in a straight-up showdown.
[Alma 2:30] Alma, flexing serious faith vibes, shouted out, "Yo Lord, have mercy, keep me alive so I can be your tool to save and protect our squad."
[Alma 2:31] Right after that prayer, Alma went back at Amlici with mad energy and blasted him down with the sword...straight W for Alma.
[Alma 2:32] Alma also threw hands with the Lamanite king, but the king dipped and sent his guards to catch these hands instead.
[Alma 2:33] Alma and his crew clapped back at the king's guards, took 'em down, and pushed them back like total bosses.
[Alma 2:34] So, he cleared the west riverbank of Sidon, tossing the dead Lamanites' bodies into the water, making space for his squad to cross and throw down with the Lamanites and Amlicites on that side.
[Alma 2:35] After everyone crossed the Sidon River, the Lamanites and Amlicites started running scared, even though their numbers were straight-up uncountable.
[Alma 2:36] They dipped west and north into the wilderness, way past the land's edge, but the Nephites chased hard and straight-up took them down.
[Alma 2:37] They got clapped from all sides, slayed and pushed back till they scattered west and north, ending up in the Hermounts wilderness...a place packed with savage beasts, no cap.
[Alma 2:38] Tons died in the wild from their wounds and got eaten by beasts and vultures; their bones ended up piled all over the ground, no lie.
[Alma 3:1] The Nephites who survived the war's smoke buried so many fallen it was impossible to count, then bounced back to their lands, homes, wives, and kids.
[Alma 3:2] A lot of women and kids got cut down, plus tons of their sheep, cows, and grain fields got crushed by the marching armies...total devastation.
[Alma 3:3] Tons of Lamanites and Amlicites killed by Sidon River got tossed into its waters; their bones still chill deep down in the sea, no cap.
[Alma 3:4] The Amlicites flexed their red forehead marks like the Lamanites but kept their hair long, not rocking the same shaved look.
[Alma 3:5] Lamanites kept their heads shaved, rocking just loincloths, armor, bows, arrows, stones, slings...basically battle-ready but low-key bare.
[Alma 3:6] The Lamanites' dark skin was the mark their dads got...basically a curse for rebelling against their righteous bros Nephi, Jacob, Joseph, and Sam, who were total saints.
[Alma 3:7] Their bros tried to wipe them out, so God dropped a mark on Laman, Lemuel, Ishmael's kids, and the Ishmaelitish women...a divine glow-up, but sus.
[Alma 3:8] God did this so their fam would stand out from their bros', keeping His crew safe from blending into bad vibes and falling for false traditions that'd wreck them.
[Alma 3:9] Word is, anyone mixing their fam with the Lamanites ended up passing that same curse onto their own squad, no cap.
[Alma 3:10] So, anyone who got pulled into the Lamanite crew was labeled under their banner and got marked accordingly, straight up.
[Alma 3:11] Anyone who ditched Lamanite traditions and vibed with the Jerusalem records plus their holy OGs' true commands got dubbed Nephites, the people of Nephi, from then on...say less.
[Alma 3:12] They're the ones who held onto the real receipts...records legit about their own crew and the Lamanites too, no cap.
[Alma 3:13] Back to the Amlicites...they flexed a red mark on their own foreheads, self-tagging with that same vibe, no cap.
[Alma 3:14] God's prophecy hit...He told Nephi: I cursed the Lamanites and marked them so their squad stays separate from yours forever, unless they bounce from their bad vibes and hit me up for mercy.
[Alma 3:15] Also, anyone mixing their squad with your bros is getting tagged with a mark and catching the same curse, no cap.
[Alma 3:16] Plus, anyone throwing hands against you and your fam? They're getting marked too...God's no joke on this.
[Alma 3:17] Also, if someone dips from your squad, they ain't getting called your fam no more; God's blessing you and whoever stays true to your line from now till forever...straight from the Lord's promise to Nephi and his crew.
[Alma 3:18] The Amlicites low-key didn't realize they were ticking off God's prophecy by marking their foreheads, but since they straight up rebelled, the curse was bound to smack them down.
[Alma 3:19] Just so you know, they pulled the curse on themselves, and honestly, anyone cursed is just collecting their own L...own moves, own consequences.
[Alma 3:20] Not long after the Zarahemla battle between Lamanites and Amlicites, another Lamanite squad rolled up on the Nephites at the same spot where the OG fight went down.
[Alma 3:21] Then, an army got dispatched to kick those invaders straight outta their land, no cap.
[Alma 3:22] Alma was rocking a nasty wound, so he had to sit this Lamanite battle out, no flex.
[Alma 3:23] Still, Alma rolled out a huge army that went hard on the Lamanites, taking down mad of them and yeeting the rest off their turf.
[Alma 3:24] After that W, they bounced back and started flexing peace in the land, chilling without enemy drama for a hot minute.
[Alma 3:25] All this tea...wars and beef...went down and wrapped up in year five of the judges' reign, no cap.
[Alma 3:26] In just one year, mad souls got sent to the eternal realm to catch their dues...good or bad vibes, stacking up either eternal happiness or misery depending on which spirit they chose to follow, no cap.
[Alma 3:27] Everyone gets paid based on who they choose to obey, straight from the spirit of prophecy's playbook...so let's keep it real. And that wraps up year five of the judges' reign.
[Alma 4:1] Rolling into year six of the judges' reign, Nephi's crew had zero beef or wars going down in Zarahemla...total chill vibes.
[Alma 4:2] Still, the people were majorly shook, mourning their bros, lost herds, and crushed grain fields stomped out by the Lamanites...big L energy all around.
[Alma 4:3] Their pain was so real, everyone was deep in the feels, thinking God was throwing shade 'cause of their wicked moves; this woke them up to remember their real responsibilities, no cap.
[Alma 4:4] They started leveling up the church big time; tons got dunked in the Sidon waters and joined God's squad, all blessed by Alma...high priest vibes handed down from his dad Alma, say less.
[Alma 4:5] By year seven of the judges' reign, around 3,500 peeps joined God's crew and got baptized...straight-up unity. That year closed with peace on lock in Nephi's land, no cap.
[Alma 4:6] Roll into year eight, church peeps started getting majorly cocky flexing mad riches...silks, linen, flocks, herds, gold, silver, all that drip they earned...getting full-on big-headed and rockin' pricey fits, no cap.
[Alma 4:7] This flexing pride hit Alma and his squad of teachers, priests, and elders hard...they were all low-key heartbroken seeing the squad's vibe go full sus with wickedness.
[Alma 4:8] They saw straight-up sadness as church folks got mad prideful, all about the bag and clout, starting to throw shade at each other and even going after the non-believers just 'cause they felt like it...big sus move.
[Alma 4:9] So in year eight, church squad got mad toxic...beef, envy, drama, hate, and flexin' pride that even outshined the non-believers'...straight-up chaos in God's crew.
[Alma 4:10] Year eight closed and the church's toxic vibes became a huge trip-up for outsiders, making the whole squad's glow-up start sliding downhill.
[Alma 4:11] Kicking off year nine, Alma peeped the church's wicked flex and realized their bad example was dragging unbelievers down the sin spiral, putting everyone on the path to ruin, no cap.
[Alma 4:12] Alma saw the squad was mad unequal...some flexing pride hard, throwing shade, ignoring the needy, the naked, the hungry, thirsty, sick, and all the messed-up folks.
[Alma 4:13] This made a lot of people straight-up sad, while others humbled themselves, helping out the needy, sharing their stuff, feeding the hungry, and grinding through all the pain for Christ's sake, who's coming as foretold.
[Alma 4:14] They stayed hyped for that day, holding onto their sins being wiped clean, vibing with mad joy over the dead rising...all thanks to Jesus flexing His power, breaking death's chains.
[Alma 4:15] Alma saw the humble God's crew getting wrecked by their own people, mad inequality everywhere, and he got heavy-hearted...but the Lord's Spirit stayed solid with him, no cap.
[Alma 4:16] Alma picked a smart elder and gave him clout, backed by the people's voice, to drop laws based on the OG rules and flex enforcement depending on how sus and criminal folks got.
[Alma 4:17] This dude Nephihah got the chief judge title and took his spot on the judgment throne, ready to run the show and judge the squad.
[Alma 4:18] Alma kept his high priest flex for himself, didn't hand that over, but passed the judgment-seat to Nephihah to run the legal vibes.
[Alma 4:19] Alma did this so he could hit the Nephi streets, preaching God's word to hype folks up about their duty, smashing pride, sneaky moves, and beef with straight-up pure receipts and no chill.
[Alma 4:20] At the start of year nine, Alma handed the judgment-seat to Nephihah and locked in fully on his high priest duties, flexing the word with that revelation and prophecy drip.
[Alma 5:1] So Alma started dropping God's word on the Zarahemla crew first, then flexed it all across the land.
[Alma 5:2] Here's what Alma said to the Zarahemla church squad, straight from his own notes, saying:
[Alma 5:3] I, Alma, got the high priest drip from my dad Alma...who had God's blessing to run this...started the church in Nephi's land, aka the land of Mormon, and baptized my bros in Mormon's waters, no cap.
[Alma 5:4] For real, they got saved from king Noah's crew thanks to God's mercy and flexed power, no cap.
[Alma 5:5] Then they got snatched by the Lamanites in the wilderness, straight-up captive, but the Lord pulled through again with word power, bringing us here to set up God's church all over this land too.
[Alma 5:6] Yo fam in the church, you low-key remember your ancestors' captivity? And God's mad mercy and patience with them? Plus, don't forget He saved their souls from straight-up hell...say less.
[Alma 5:7] God flipped their hearts, woke them from a deep sleep straight to Him; even trapped in darkness, His eternal word lit their souls up, though death's chains and endless destruction were waiting.
[Alma 5:8] So I gotta ask you, fam, did they get destroyed? Nah, straight-up no L's for them.
[Alma 5:9] And again, did death's chains snap and hell's grip loosen? Bet, they broke free, souls leveled up, singing that redeeming love, and yeah...they're saved, no cap.
[Alma 5:10] So what's the tea...how'd they earn salvation? What gave them hope to break death and hell's chains? Spill the receipts.
[Alma 5:11] Look, I'm telling you...didn't my dad Alma vibe with Abinadi's words? He was a legit prophet, spoke straight God talk, and my dad believed every word, no cap.
[Alma 5:12] And because of that faith, his heart went through a major glow-up. No cap, I'm telling you, this is all facts.
[Alma 5:13] He preached to your dads, sparked a heart glow-up in them too; they got humble, put faith in the real, living God, stayed loyal till the end, and boom...they got saved.
[Alma 5:14] Yo church fam, have you been spiritually reborn by God? Got His vibe showing on your faces? Feel that deep heart glow-up yet?
[Alma 5:15] Are you flexing faith in the Redeemer who made you? Peepin' the future with hope, seeing your mortal self glow up to immortality, ready to face God's judgment based on your mortal moves?
[Alma 5:16] Imagine God hits you up saying, "Come thru, blessed ones, your deeds on earth were straight-up righteous"...you feeling that vibe or nah?
[Alma 5:17] Or you really think you can front God that day, say "Yo, our works were clean," and He's just gonna save you? Nah, that's mad sus.
[Alma 5:18] Or can you even imagine showing up before God's court with your soul drowning in guilt, remembering every single wicked move you made, straight-up defying His commandments? That's some heavy vibe check.
[Alma 5:19] Real talk, can you face God that day with a pure heart and clean hands? Can you flex the God image stamped on your face and not fold?
[Alma 5:20] Tell me, can you even vibe with salvation if you've low-key handed your soul over to the devil's squad?
[Alma 5:21] Bet, on that day you'll get it: no one's making it saved without their clothes clean...like washed spotless, no cap...only purified by the blood of the one our ancestors said would come to snatch his people from sin.
[Alma 5:22] So, fam, how you gonna feel standing before God with your robes stained in blood and straight-up filth? Think about what those stains are gonna say about you...major receipts against your vibe.
[Alma 5:23] For real, won't those stains shout out that you're murderers and packed with every kind of wickedness? No cap, it's receipts all day.
[Alma 5:24] Yo, do you really think someone like that gets a spot chillin' in God's kingdom with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the pure prophets rocking spotless, fresh white fit? Nah, that's a no from me.
[Alma 5:25] Nah fam, unless you wanna call our Creator a liar from jump, you gotta accept that those kinds ain't getting into heaven...they're getting booted 'cause they rollin' with the devil's crew.
[Alma 5:26] So listen up, fam...if you've had that heart flip and caught the vibe of redeeming love, I gotta ask: you still feeling it right now or nah?
[Alma 5:27] Have you been walking clean, no cap, before God? If death slid into your DMs right now, could you low-key say you been humble enough, your robes legit washed white by Christ's blood...the one who's coming to save his squad from sin?
[Alma 5:28] Yo, have you dropped the pride flex? If not, you're straight-up unready to face God. Better get that glow-up fast 'cause heaven's coming soon, and prideful ones ain't getting that eternal life W.
[Alma 5:29] Look, anyone still holding onto envy? Nope, you ain't ready. Better fix that ASAP 'cause the clock's ticking and you don't even know when the big moment drops. Trust, envy won't slide guilt-free.
[Alma 5:30] And for real, is there anyone out here clowning on their brother or piling on the hate like it's a flex?
[Alma 5:31] Big yikes for that dude...unprepared and the clock's ticking to repent, or it's game over for salvation, no cap!
[Alma 5:32] Deadass, big yikes to all you sin hustlers...repent, repent, 'cause the Lord God just dropped that command, say less!
[Alma 5:33] Look, God's sending an open invite to everyone, mercy arms wide open like a squad call: Repent and I got you, no cap.
[Alma 5:34] For real, He's like: Pull up to me and you'll vibe with the fruit of the tree of life...eat, drink, and feast on the bread and waters of life, all free no strings attached.
[Alma 5:35] Bet, roll up to me with your good deeds on deck, and you won't get cut down or tossed into the fire...no cap.
[Alma 5:36] Heads up, the time's now: anyone not dropping good fruit or righteous moves got major reasons to cry and catch those L's.
[Alma 5:37] Yo, sin squad flexing on worldly clout, acting like you know righteousness but lowkey lost like sheep without a shepherd...even though the Shepherd's been calling you out and still is...and y'all ignoring the rizz, straight ghosting His voice!
[Alma 5:38] Look, the good Shepherd's calling you by name...Christ's name, no cap...and if you're not vibing with His voice, then newsflash: you ain't part of His flock.
[Alma 5:39] So if you ain't rolling with the good Shepherd's squad, whose team you reppin'? Spoiler: the devil's got you, and that's facts. Anyone denying this is straight-up lying and low-key devil's kid, no cap.
[Alma 5:40] Real talk: all that's good vibes comes straight from God, and all that sus evil energy is from the devil, no debate.
[Alma 5:41] So if someone's out here doing good stuff, they're tuning into the good Shepherd's vibes and following Him; but if they're dropping evil moves, they're basically devil's spawn, vibing with his voice and trailing behind.
[Alma 5:42] Whoever's on that evil grind gotta get their paycheck from him...meaning death when it comes to righteousness, basically ghosted from all good deeds.
[Alma 5:43] Yo fam, listen up ... I'm pouring my soul out here, speaking straight facts, no cap; I've kept it 100 with God's commandments, so no way to mess this up.
[Alma 5:44] I'm legit called to talk like this, following God's OG plan through Christ Jesus; straight up ordered to stand and drop receipts about what our ancestors said is coming down the line.
[Alma 5:45] Hold up, it ain't just talk ... you really think I'm clueless? Facts: I know these truths for real, and you wanna know how? Say less, I got receipts.
[Alma 5:46] Straight up, the Holy Spirit's the plug dropping these truths in my DM's; I've been fasting and praying non-stop to get the full tea, and now I know for sure...God revealed it all to me through His Holy Spirit, that's the real spirit of revelation lit up inside me.
[Alma 5:47] Plus, I've been shown straight up that the words our ancestors dropped are legit, all confirmed by the prophecy vibes inside me powered by the Spirit of God's glow-up.
[Alma 5:48] No cap, I know whatever I say about the future is straight facts; Jesus Christ...the Son, the One and Only of the Father, packed with grace, mercy, and truth...is coming to snatch away the sins of the world, every single person who's riding steady on His name.
[Alma 5:49] So yeah, this is my mission: preaching to my beloved fam, everyone in the land...old, young, locked up or free; shoutout to the elders, mid-lifers, and Gen Z...telling them all to repent and get that fresh start, no cap.
[Alma 5:50] For real, the Spirit's yelling: repent, everyone everywhere, 'cause heaven's kingdom is pulling up soon; the Son of God's coming flexing His glory, power, and full-on majesty. Yo, fam, the Spirit's saying: peep the King of Earth's glow-up, and the King of Heaven's about to shine bright on all humanity.
[Alma 5:51] And the Spirit's straight-up yelling at me, loud as hell: go tell these folks to repent, 'cause no repentance means no way you're getting into heaven's squad, no cap.
[Alma 5:52] Spirit's back at me like, the ax is right at the tree's roots...any tree not dropping good fruit's getting chopped and tossed into that eternal, unquenchable fire. Fact: the Holy One said it, so keep that locked in.
[Alma 5:53] Yo, my beloved crew, can y'all really handle these truths? For real, can you just ghost these words, stomp on the Holy One, get all big-headed, and keep flexing with pricey drip and chasing empty worldly clout like it's the main thing?
[Alma 5:54] So, y'all gonna keep thinking you're all that, better than the rest? Keep bullying your humble bros who follow God's holy order, got cleaned up by the Holy Spirit, and are out here dropping legit repentance moves? Nah, that's sus.
[Alma 5:55] So, you're really gonna keep ignoring the poor and needy, straight-up blocking your resources from them? That's cold, fr.
[Alma 5:56] And real talk, y'all sticking to your wicked ways? You're the ones getting chopped and tossed into the fire unless you bounce back and repent, ASAP.
[Alma 5:57] So if you're down to follow the good shepherd's vibe, dip from the wicked, stay separate, don't mess with their messy stuff; their names will get erased...wicked and righteous names don't mix...God's word says so, no cap.
[Alma 5:58] The righteous get their names inked in the book of life and score an inheritance chillin' at God's right hand. So, fam, what's your clapback? Doesn't matter if you throw shade...God's word is locked and loaded, gotta happen.
[Alma 5:59] Yo, what shepherd with a big flock doesn't keep an eye out so wolves don't crash and eat his crew? Bet he chases those wolves off, and if he can, ends them for good.
[Alma 5:60] The good shepherd's calling you, and if you vibe with His voice, He'll pull you into His squad as His sheep, commanding you to keep any savage wolf out so y'all don't get wrecked.
[Alma 5:61] Yo, I'm Alma, laying down commands straight from the One who orders me...make sure you actually do the stuff I just told you, no slacking.
[Alma 5:62] To my church fam, this is a straight-up command; to the outsiders, consider this your invite: roll through, get baptized for repentance, and flex on the blessings from the tree of life.
[Alma 6:1] So after Alma finished dropping knowledge to the Zarahemla church crew, he laid hands on priests and elders, officially making them squad leaders to run and guard the church...God's order, no cap.
[Alma 6:2] Anyone outside the church who did a 180 on their sins got baptized for real and got added to the church squad.
[Alma 6:3] And for the church peeps who stayed stubborn, too full of pride to humble themselves, they got the ultimate L...their names erased and left off the righteous list.
[Alma 6:4] That's how they kicked off setting up the church's system in Zarahemla, no cap.
[Alma 6:5] Just so you get it, God's word was spread wide open...no one got left out from pulling up and hearing it together.
[Alma 6:6] But listen up, God's squad got told to squad up often, fasting and sending up mad prayers for the souls still out here clueless about God.
[Alma 6:7] After Alma set these rules, he bounced from the Zarahemla church and crossed the Sidon river east into Gideon's valley, where the city of Gideon sat...named after the dude Nehor offed with a sword.
[Alma 6:8] Alma rolled up to the Gideon valley church, preaching God's word straight from his forefathers' truth, powered by prophecy in him, all backed by Jesus Christ's testimony...the Son of God coming to snag His people from sin, called by that sacred order. And yeah, that's how it's written. Amen.
[Alma 7:1] Yo, my beloved bros, since I finally got the green light to pull up, I'm hitting you with my own words...first time speaking face-to-face 'cause I was stuck grinding at the judgment seat, mad busy and couldn't slide through sooner.
[Alma 7:2] Honestly, I wouldn't be here now if they hadn't handed my judgment-seat gig to someone else, and God, being mad merciful, let me roll through to you all.
[Alma 7:3] Look, I pulled up hoping y'all had kept it humble before God, stayed on that grind asking for His grace, and were clean before Him...not caught up in the same mess our Zarahemla bros got stuck in.
[Alma 7:4] Big ups to God, who blessed me with mad joy knowing our bros got back on track, locked in the walk of His righteousness.
[Alma 7:5] I'm vibing with God's Spirit in me, hoping to catch that same joy with you, but low-key I don't want it to come from the same heavy drama and pain I dealt with for the Zarahemla crew; my joy with them only came after swimming through mad affliction and pain.
[Alma 7:6] But fr, I'm betting you're not stuck in the same unbelief as your bros, not flexing with pride, not caught up chasing clout or dead idols, but worshipping the real, living God, and hyped for your sins to be wiped clean with that eternal faith coming through.
[Alma 7:7] Look, tons of stuff's coming, but real talk, one thing tops all...soon enough the Redeemer's gonna be alive and sliding through to His people.
[Alma 7:8] Yo, I'm not saying He'll roll up like back when He was rocking that mortal body...Spirit's been quiet on that...but one thing's clear: the Lord God's got all the power to flex whatever He promised.
[Alma 7:9] The Spirit told me straight up: Tell these folks to repent, get ready for the Lord's arrival, and stay on His straight path, 'cause the kingdom of heaven's about to drop and the Son of God is coming to earth.
[Alma 7:10] Bet, He's gonna be born to Mary in Jerusalem...our OG homeland...she's a virgin, a top-tier chosen one, who'll be overshadowed and conceive by the Holy Ghost's power, dropping a son, the Son of God Himself.
[Alma 7:11] He's about to step up, catching all kinds of pain, struggles, and temptations, so the prophecy's lit...He's taking on the pain and sickness of His people, no cap.
[Alma 7:12] He's gonna flex by taking on death to break the chains holding His people down, and carry their weaknesses so He feels mad mercy in His flesh and knows exactly how to help them through their struggles.
[Alma 7:13] The Spirit's got all the tea, but the Son of God suffers in the flesh to cop the sins of His people and erase their mess-ups by His dope power; and yo, that's the real tea I'm holding down.
[Alma 7:14] Listen up, y'all gotta repent and get reborn; the Spirit says no rebirth means no kingdom of heaven pass. So, pull up, get baptized for real to cleanse your sins and flex faith in the Lamb of God, who's boss at saving and wiping out all the messed-up stuff.
[Alma 7:15] For real, come thru and don't sweat it; drop the sins that low-key trap you and drag you down. Roll up, show God you're down to repent and lock in a covenant by straight-up getting baptized today.
[Alma 7:16] Anyone who does that and sticks to God's commandments will low-key remember I told them straight up...they're getting eternal life, based on the Holy Spirit's vibes testifying through me.
[Alma 7:17] Yo, my beloved fam, you feeling these facts? Bet, I know you do 'cause the Spirit's flexin' through me. Your strong faith in what I dropped has got me hyped with mad joy.
[Alma 7:18] Like I said from the jump, I really wanted y'all to avoid that sus dilemma your bros got caught in...and low-key, my wishes just got fulfilled.
[Alma 7:19] I see you're vibing on the righteous path; no cap, you're cruising straight toward God's kingdom and making His routes legit smooth.
[Alma 7:20] I peep that His word showed y'all He don't do no switch-ups or crooked moves...He's always on the straight and narrow, no cap, never flipping from right to wrong; His game's an eternal, unchanging loop.
[Alma 7:21] He ain't chilling in unholy spots, and no cap, dirt or any kinda mess can't slide into God's kingdom; so yeah, on the last day, anyone still stuck in their filth gonna stay right there.
[Alma 7:22] Yo, beloved fam, I'm dropping these truths to wake you up to your duty to God so you can flex clean before Him and roll with the holy squad He brought you into.
[Alma 7:23] So yeah, stay humble, chill, easy to vibe with, patient AF, keeping your cool, grinding on God's commandments 24/7, asking for what you need...spiritual or real-life...and always shooting thanks up to God for what you get.
[Alma 7:24] Keep that faith, hope, and charity on deck, and you'll be flexing good deeds nonstop, no cap.
[Alma 7:25] Bet, may the Lord bless you and keep your fit spotless so you can pull up and chill forever with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the OG prophets, all decked out clean in heaven, never dipping out again.
[Alma 7:26] Yo beloved fam, I'm speaking these truths powered by the Spirit vibing in me, and low-key my soul's hyped AF 'cause you've been grinding hard and actually tuning into my word.
[Alma 7:27] So, may God's peace chill on you, your cribs, lands, flocks, herds, everything you own, your women and kids...based on your faith and good deeds...from now, forever. Say less. Amen.
[Alma 8:1] So Alma bounced back from Gideon after schooling the peeps there on mad stuff that's too wild to write down, setting up the church's vibe like he did in Zarahemla, then dipped to his own spot in Zarahemla to catch some well-earned rest from all that grind.
[Alma 8:2] And just like that, the ninth year of the judges running the Nephi squad wrapped up.
[Alma 8:3] At the jump of year ten of the judges' run over the Nephi crew, Alma dipped and headed west to Melek, near the Sidon river and the edge of the wilderness.
[Alma 8:4] Alma started schooling the Melek peeps on God's holy vibe, the one he was called for, spreading that knowledge all over the land.
[Alma 8:5] Basically, folks flooded to him from all around the wilderness borders, and everyone was getting baptized all across the land.
[Alma 8:6] After wrapping up his Melek mission, Alma bounced, trekking three days north till he rolled up to the city called Ammonihah.
[Alma 8:7] So check it, the Nephi squad's habit was naming lands, cities, and even tiny villages after whoever first claimed them...same deal with Ammonihah.
[Alma 8:8] When Alma hit up Ammonihah city, he started dropping God's word on the crowd, no cap.
[Alma 8:9] But real talk, Satan had clutched the hearts of Ammonihah's crew tight, so they straight-up ignored Alma's words.
[Alma 8:10] Still, Alma went hard in the spirit, grinding in prayer battles with God, begging Him to drop His Spirit on the city peeps and let Alma dunk them into repentance.
[Alma 8:11] But nah, they clapped back, all cold: "We see you're Alma, the high priest running your church everywhere, but we ain't part of that squad and don't vibe with those lame traditions."
[Alma 8:12] And they flexed: "Since we ain't in your church, you got no clout over us; you handed the judge spot to Nephihah, so you ain't the main judge here."
[Alma 8:13] After they said all that, cussed him out, spat on him, and kicked him outta their city, Alma dipped and headed towards the city named Aaron.
[Alma 8:14] As Alma trekked to Aaron, carrying mad sorrow and soul pain over Ammonihah's wickedness, boom...an angel of the Lord showed up and said:
[Alma 8:15] "Blessed, Alma," the angel said, "So lift your head and flex that joy... you've been solid AF keeping God's commands since day one when I dropped that message to you."
[Alma 8:16] "Listen up, I'm sent to order you back to Ammonihah to drop the preach once more...tell them straight up, no repentance means Lord God's gonna wipe them out."
[Alma 8:17] Yo, they're scheming right now to snatch your people's freedom...straight disrespect to God's laws and commands, no cap.
[Alma 8:18] As soon as Alma got the angel's message, he bounced mad quick back to Ammonihah, sneaking in from the south side...gotta keep it low-key.
[Alma 8:19] Rolling into the city hungry AF, Alma asked a dude, "Yo, can you hook up a humble servant of God with some food?"
[Alma 8:20] The guy was like, "I'm a Nephite and I know you're God's prophet...angel said you'd show up. Roll with me to my crib, I got food, and I know you'll bless me and my fam."
[Alma 8:21] So Amulek let Alma into his place, pulled out some bread and meat, and served him up real quick.
[Alma 8:22] Alma ate that bread, got fully satisfied, then blessed Amulek and his squad, giving mad thanks to God.
[Alma 8:23] After he was stuffed, Alma told Amulek, "Yo, I'm Alma, the high priest running the church of God all over this land."
[Alma 8:24] "Look, I was called to preach God's word here by straight-up prophecy vibes; but these folks ghosted me, kicked me out, and I was ready to dip from this land for good."
[Alma 8:25] But check it, I got orders to bounce back and drop prophecy on these people, calling out their shady moves no cap.
[Alma 8:26] Amulek, since you fed me and let me crash, you're blessed...been fasting mad days, so I was straight-up starving.
[Alma 8:27] Alma chilled with Amulek for days before he started preaching to the crowd.
[Alma 8:28] Meanwhile, the people kept leveling up in their wickedness...no cap, getting way more sus.
[Alma 8:29] Word hit Alma: "Go, and tell my dude Amulek to flex those prophecy skills...repent or else God's coming down mad angry, no chill, and won't hold back."
[Alma 8:30] Alma and Amulek rolled up to the people, dropping God's truth, and got fully vibing with the Holy Ghost.
[Alma 8:31] They were flexing mad power...couldn't be locked up or killed...but didn't even use it till they got chained and thrown in jail, just so the Lord could stunt through them.
[Alma 8:32] They bounced out and started preaching and prophesying to the crowd, all powered up by the Lord's spirit...no cap.
[Alma 9:1] So yeah, I, Alma, got God's orders to squad up with Amulek and preach to the Ammonihah crew...but as soon as I started, they clapped back hard, throwing shade and arguments my way.
[Alma 9:2] They hit me like, "Who even are you? You really think we'll trust some solo act preaching the world's gonna end? Bet."
[Alma 9:3] Lowkey, they didn't even get what they were saying...they had zero clue the earth was really gonna dip.
[Alma 9:4] They also threw shade like, "Nah, we ain't buying your prophecy that this whole city's gonna get wrecked in a single day."
[Alma 9:5] They low-key slept on God's power, thinking He couldn't pull off miracles, 'cause they were straight-up stubborn and unflexible.
[Alma 9:6] They clowned, "Who even is God, sending just one dude with the receipts to spill these wild truths to us?"
[Alma 9:7] They tried to squad up and grab me, but surprise...they backed off. I stayed unbothered, flexing bold vibes as I dropped the truth on them, no cap.
[Alma 9:8] Yo, wicked and twisted squad, how you guys already ghosted your forefathers' legacy and bounced on God's commandments so fast?
[Alma 9:9] Don't you remember our OG Lehi got the divine VIP pass outta Jerusalem? And that God was the real MVP guiding them through the wilderness grind?
[Alma 9:10] You already forgot how many times he saved our ancestors from their haters, even when the threat was their own fam? Talk about clutch plays.
[Alma 9:11] Fr, if it wasn't for his unbeatable power, mercy, and mad patience, we'd be wiped off the map ages ago, stuck in endless L-ville and no cap, total misery.
[Alma 9:12] Listen up, he's straight-up telling y'all to repent; no repentance, no throne in God's kingdom. And no cap, if you don't, he'll yeet you off the earth with mad anger that won't chill.
[Alma 9:13] Yo, don't you remember God telling Lehi, "Keep my commandments and you'll flex success in this land"? And if you ghost my rules, you'll get cut off from God's presence, no cap.
[Alma 9:14] Just saying, since the Lamanites ghosted God's commandments, they've been straight-up cut off from His presence. No cap, God's word proved right...since day one of their mess-ups, they've been dodged by the Lord.
[Alma 9:15] Real talk, on Judgment Day it'll be less rough for the Lamanites than for y'all if you keep vibin' in sin; even now, their life's more chill than yours...unless you hit that repentance button.
[Alma 9:16] Lots of promises are lined up for the Lamanites; their vibe's stuck 'cause of their ancestors' traditions, so God's flexing mercy and letting them stay in the land longer.
[Alma 9:17] Eventually, they'll catch the tea, realize their parents' traditions were sus, and many will get saved 'cause God's got mercy for anyone who calls His name, no cap.
[Alma 9:18] Bet, if you keep flexing wickedness, your time in the land's gonna be short...Lamanites will roll up on you when you least expect it, bringing full-on destruction powered by God's savage wrath.
[Alma 9:19] God won't let you live in your sins just to wreck His people; He'd rather let the Lamanites finish the job if His people of Nephi keep throwing away the major glow-up of knowledge and light He gave them.
[Alma 9:20] Yeah, after being God's top-tier squad, flexed on every nation, tribe, and language; getting all the tea revealed based on their faith and prayers about past, present, and future...no cap.
[Alma 9:21] They've been blessed with visits from the Spirit, chattin' with angels, hearing God's voice, rocking prophecy, revelation, and mad gifts like tongues, preaching, the Holy Ghost, and translation ... straight-up main-character energy.
[Alma 9:22] Facts: God pulled them outta Jerusalem, saved them from famine, sickness, and all kinds of bad vibes; they got strong in battle to avoid getting wiped, got freed from bondage repeatedly, kept safe till now, and have been blessed with mad wealth in everything.
[Alma 9:23] Look, if these peeps who've been blessed big time by God decide to ignore the light and knowledge they've got and fall into sin, trust me, it'd be way more chill for the Lamanites than for them.
[Alma 9:24] Yo, God's promises are up for the Lamanites, but if y'all mess up, no cap, those blessings bounce; He straight-up said if you rebel, you're getting wiped off the map.
[Alma 9:25] So, to save y'all from getting wiped, God sent His angel to hit up His people, telling them to blast this message loud: Repent, 'cause heaven's kingdom is coming in hot.
[Alma 9:26] In no time, the Son of God's rolling in with mad glory...like the one and only of the Father...stacked with grace, fairness, truth, patience, mercy, and mad endurance; He's all ears when His people call and always hits back with the answers.
[Alma 9:27] Look, He's coming to save the ones who get baptized in repentance, trusting straight up in His name...say less.
[Alma 9:28] So get the path ready for the Lord 'cause the time's near when everyone gets paid back for their grind...if you played righteous, you snag soul salvation via Jesus' power; if you went evil, you catch soul damnation courtesy of the devil's clout.
[Alma 9:29] Yo, this is the angel's voice yelling at the people loud and clear.
[Alma 9:30] Yo, my fam, since y'all my brethren and should be loved, it's time to drop acts worthy of real repentance...'cause your hearts are mad hardened against God's word, and y'all lowkey lost and fallen.
[Alma 9:31] So when I, Alma, dropped these truth bombs, the crowd got mad salty 'cause I called them hard-hearted and stubborn AF.
[Alma 9:32] Plus, when I said they were lost and fallen, they got all heated and tried to grab me to throw me in jail...big sus energy.
[Alma 9:33] But low-key, the Lord didn't let them snatch me or lock me up that day...He had my back, no cap.
[Alma 9:34] Then Amulek stepped up and started preaching too; not all his words made the cut, but some got recorded in this book, say less.
[Alma 10:1] So here's the drip from Amulek preaching to the squad in Ammonihah, saying:
[Alma 10:2] I'm Amulek, straight-up son of Giddonah, son of Ishmael, from the Aminadi line...the same dude who flexed by interpreting the divine wall writing God finger-painted in the temple, no cap.
[Alma 10:3] Aminadi's fam tree traces back to Nephi, son of Lehi who bounced from Jerusalem, repping Manasseh's crew...he's Joseph's son, the same Joseph who got sold to Egypt by his own bros, straight up wild.
[Alma 10:4] Low-key, I'm no nobody...got mad rep with my peeps, plus hella fam and friends, and I stacked serious riches through my own grind, no handouts.
[Alma 10:5] Even with all that clout, I used to think I barely knew God's ways or flex power...but nah, I was wrong...I've seen plenty of His mysteries and epic power, especially in keeping these folks safe.
[Alma 10:6] Still, I built up mad walls 'cause I got called plenty but ghosted the vibes; I knew the deal but acted clueless and kept vibin' with wickedness straight up until day four of month seven, tenth year of the judges' reign...big L energy.
[Alma 10:7] While I was rolling to see close fam, an angel popped up and said, "Amulek, bounce back home and feed a Lord prophet...a holy dude who's been fasting hard 'cause of these people's sins and is starving; take him in, feed him, and he'll bless you and your crib, and God's blessings will stick with you both."
[Alma 10:8] So I listened to the angel's call, dipped back to my place, and on the way, I ran into the exact guy the angel said to let in...this dude's the one schooling y'all on God's stuff, no cap.
[Alma 10:9] The angel told me he's a holy dude, and I'm taking that to the bank since an angel of God said it...no cap, that's legit holiness confirmed.
[Alma 10:10] For real, I know his testimony's on point 'cause, deadass, the Lord sent His angel to prove it to me...and all this went down while Alma was crashing at my spot.
[Alma 10:11] No cap, he blessed my whole house...me, my women, kids, dad, and the whole fam squad; God's blessing hit us hard just like he said it would.
[Alma 10:12] When Amulek dropped those bars, the crowd got shook realizing there was more than one witness backing up the receipts ... both the accusations and the future predictions, all straight from their prophecy vibes.
[Alma 10:13] But some folks were low-key sus, trying to trap them with slick talk to snag receipts and hand them over to the judges for a legal roast...hoping to lock them up or get them killed based on whatever dirt they could dig up.
[Alma 10:14] The real villains were these lawyer dudes, hired by the people to flex the law during trials and handle crime cases before the judges...basically the legal sharks out to wreck them.
[Alma 10:15] These lawyers were mad skilled in all the tricks and sneaky moves of the crowd, so they could ace their grind and own their profession, no cap.
[Alma 10:16] Then they started grilling Amulek, aiming to catch him slipping or contradicting himself...classic debate move, but he wasn't about to get ratioed.
[Alma 10:17] They had no clue Amulek peeped their sus plans, but as they started the questioning, he called them out: "Yo wicked generation, lawyers and hypocrites, y'all building the devil's HQ, setting traps to snatch God's holy squad."
[Alma 10:18] Y'all scheming to twist the righteous path and drag God's fury down on yourselves, risking the total wipeout of this whole crew.
[Alma 10:19] Mosiah, our last king, said it straight before passing the crown to no heir and letting the people run the show...he warned if they ever vibed with sin and chose wrong, they'd be straight-up doomed and ripe for destruction, no cap.
[Alma 10:20] I'm telling you, the Lord's got the receipts on your sins and He's shouting through His angels: Repent, for real...kingdom of heaven is pulling up, say less.
[Alma 10:21] For real, He's flexing through His angels, saying: I'm rolling up to my people bringing straight-up fairness and justice in hand.
[Alma 10:22] No cap, if it wasn't for the righteous squad praying right now, y'all would be getting wrecked...not by a flood like Noah's crew, but by famine, disease, and straight-up sword energy.
[Alma 10:23] It's only cause the righteous are praying y'all aren't toast; but if you kick them out, the Lord won't hold back...He'll pull up mad angry, and famine, plague, and sword will wreck you, real soon if you don't repent.
[Alma 10:24] So the crowd got mad salty at Amulek, yelling he's throwing shade at their "just" laws and the "wise" lawyers they picked...big mood, not the vibe.
[Alma 10:25] Amulek raised his hand, going harder: "Yo wicked, twisted crowd, why is Satan low-key holding your hearts hostage? Why let him flex so hard that your eyes get blind and you can't peep the truth in these words?"
[Alma 10:26] Look, did I throw shade on your law? Nah, y'all just don't get it; you say I'm against it, but I'm actually backing it up...to your own downfall, bet.
[Alma 10:27] Listen up, the whole collapse of this squad is about to start 'cause your lawyers and judges are out here acting mad unrighteous, laying the groundwork for disaster.
[Alma 10:28] After Amulek dropped those bars, the crowd threw shade saying, "Bet, this dude's def a devil's kid, lying to us; he trashed our law but now acts like he didn't...mad sus."
[Alma 10:29] Plus, he just came at our lawyers and judges like they're the problem, no chill.
[Alma 10:30] So the lawyers low-key decided to keep these receipts on him and hold that grudge tight.
[Alma 10:31] Among them was Zeezrom, the top dog at roasting Amulek and Alma...he had mad skill and was big on the hustle with the people.
[Alma 10:32] These lawyers were all about that bread, and they scored gains based on their hustle.
[Alma 11:1] So Mosiah's law said judges get paid based on how long they grind hearing the cases dropped in front of them...time is money, no cap.
[Alma 11:2] If someone owed cash and ghosted on paying up, folks dragged him to court; the judge flexed authority, sent officers to cuff him, then judged based on the receipts...and dude had to pay up or get exposed, stripped, or banned as a straight-up thief.
[Alma 11:3] The judge got paid by the day...either a gold senine or a silver senum (same flex value)...all straight from the law's playbook.
[Alma 11:4] Here's the rundown on their gold and silver coins by value, named by the Nephites...not copying the Jews' system in Jerusalem...but they switched up the measures and counts to fit their vibe and times until king Mosiah's judges came through.
[Alma 11:5] So the lineup goes: senine gold, seon gold, shum gold, and limnah gold...each with their own weight and flex.
[Alma 11:6] For silver, it's senum, amnor, ezrom, and onti...stacked by their own value tiers.
[Alma 11:7] A silver senum matches a gold senine in value, and both count as the measure for barley or any grain...straight up standard vibes.
[Alma 11:8] A seon of gold? Yeah, it's double the drip of a senine...twice the flex, no cap.
[Alma 11:9] A shum gold? That's double the value of a seon...stacking up big time.
[Alma 11:10] The limnah gold? That's the whole package...worth all the others combined, no joke.
[Alma 11:11] An amnor silver flexes like two senums stacked...double the drip in silver form.
[Alma 11:12] An ezrom silver? That's four senums mashed together...quadruple silver sauce.
[Alma 11:13] The onti silver? Big boss move...worth all the others combined, straight up top-tier.
[Alma 11:14] Here's the tea on the smaller counts in their money game...keep up.
[Alma 11:15] A shiblon's like half a senum, so it's good for half a barley measure...halfway flex, feel me?
[Alma 11:16] A shiblum? That's half a shiblon...splitting it down to the smallest drip.
[Alma 11:17] A leah's half a shiblum...we're talking micro flexes now.
[Alma 11:18] So yeah, that's their number game, straight from their own math playbook.
[Alma 11:19] An antion gold? That's equal to three shiblons...triple the mini flex, no cap.
[Alma 11:20] They were all about that bag, getting paid by the job, so they hyped up riots and chaos to keep the cash flowin', stirring the crowd against Alma and Amulek just to score more skrilla from the court drama.
[Alma 11:21] Zeezrom slid up to Amulek like, "Yo, you down to answer some questions?" Dude was low-key sus, a devil's mastermind scheming to wreck the good stuff, so he kept pushing Amulek with his shady Qs.
[Alma 11:22] Amulek shot back, "Bet, as long as it vibes with the Spirit of the Lord inside me; no cap, I won't go against that." Zeezrom came in flexing six onties of silver, saying, "Here's the bag if you just deny the Supreme Being."
[Alma 11:23] Amulek clapped back, "Yo, child of hell, why you testing me? Don't you know righteous folks don't cave to that sus temptation?"
[Alma 11:24] You really tryna say there's no God? Nah fam, you KNOW He's real, but you're low-key obsessed with that cash way more than Him.
[Alma 11:25] Now you straight-up lied to me in front of God, saying, "Here's six onties, big flex," but you were low-key hoarding them just to trap me into denying the real living God so you could cancel me. Bet, that twisted move got you a savage payday...karma's coming for you.
[Alma 11:26] Zeezrom hit back, "Wait, you really saying there's a true and living God?"
[Alma 11:27] Amulek said straight up, "Yep, there's a real, living God, no cap."
[Alma 11:28] Zeezrom asked, "So, is there more than one God or nah?"
[Alma 11:29] Amulek shot back, "Nah, just one God, period."
[Alma 11:30] Zeezrom came back, "Alright, how you so sure about all this info?"
[Alma 11:31] Amulek said, "An angel slid into my life and dropped that knowledge on me."
[Alma 11:32] Zeezrom asked again, "Who's this dude coming? Is he the Son of God or what?"
[Alma 11:33] Amulek replied, "Yeah, that's him for sure."
[Alma 11:34] Zeezrom asked again, "So, is he gonna save his people while they keep sinning?" Amulek clapped back, "No way, fam. He can't just ghost his own word...that's impossible."
[Alma 11:35] Zeezrom told the crowd, "Keep this receipts: there's only one God, but he says the Son of God's coming and won't save his people...like he owns God or some sus flex."
[Alma 11:36] Amulek shot back, "Hold up, you lied. You twisted my words like I'm bossin' God around just 'cause I said he won't save sinners."
[Alma 11:37] I'm telling you again, he can't save y'all while y'all keep sinning; I can't cap on his word, and he said no unclean thing gets into heaven's kingdom...so how you gonna be saved unless you get in? Bottom line: no sin-saving allowed.
[Alma 11:38] Zeezrom came back with, "Wait, is the Son of God actually the Eternal Father himself?"
[Alma 11:39] Amulek said, "Yeah, he's straight-up the Eternal Father of heaven, earth, and everything in between; he's the OG and the finale, the first and the last."
[Alma 11:40] He's gonna roll into the world to save his people, taking on the sins of those who vibe with his name; only those peeps get eternal life...no cap, salvation ain't for anyone else.
[Alma 11:41] So, the wicked stay like redemption never happened, just escaping death's grip, 'cause one day everyone's gonna bounce from the dead, face God, and get judged based on their grind.
[Alma 11:42] There's this thing called temporal death...like the physical clock running out...and Christ's death is the key to unlock it so everyone can bounce back from that temporary timeout.
[Alma 11:43] The spirit and body will link back up perfectly, every limb and joint fixed just like now, and we'll flex before God fully woke...remembering all our receipts and guilt clear as day.
[Alma 11:44] Everyone gets this glow-up...old, young, slave, free, guy, girl, sinner, saint...no cap, not even a single hair lost; everything back 100% as now, then they'll stand before Christ, God the Father, and the Holy Spirit (the one Eternal God) for the ultimate vibe check based on their deeds, good or bad.
[Alma 11:45] So, I just dropped the truth: our mortal bodies die but then get resurrected into immortal ones, switching from death to straight-up eternal life, no more dying, with spirit and body fused forever...no decay, just pure spiritual immortality.
[Alma 11:46] After Amulek dropped that knowledge, the crowd was shook again, and Zeezrom started shaking in his boots...so yeah, that's where Amulek's speech caps off, at least what I got recorded.
[Alma 12:1] Alma peeped that Amulek totally shut Zeezrom down, catching his fake flex and shady moves; seeing Zeezrom quake with guilt, Alma stepped up to back Amulek's truth and spill even deeper scriptural tea beyond what Amulek dropped.
[Alma 12:2] Alma's words to Zeezrom were on blast for the big crowd nearby to hear, and he went off like this:
[Alma 12:3] Zeezrom, since you got caught slippin' with lies...not just to people but God too...know He's got full receipts on your thoughts, and you can see we got the deets straight from His Spirit.
[Alma 12:4] You gotta see we peeped your lowkey devil-level scheme...lying and gaslighting these folks just to start beef with us, talk mad trash, and kick us to the curb.
[Alma 12:5] This move was straight from your adversary's playbook, flexing big-time control over you; just know, what I'm saying to you, I'm throwing down for everyone hearing too.
[Alma 12:6] Listen up, this was the adversary's trap to snatch y'all, lock you in chains, and drag you down to eternal destruction...he's flexing his full-chain power to hold you captive forever.
[Alma 12:7] After Alma dropped that, Zeezrom started shaking even harder, totally convinced of God's power and that Alma and Amulek had full receipts on his thoughts and heart...straight-up prophecy vibes gave them that knowledge.
[Alma 12:8] Zeezrom started hitting them up for real, wanting the full tea on God's kingdom, and asked Alma: "Yo, what's the deal with Amulek's talk about resurrection...everyone, good or bad, rising to stand before God and get judged by their actions?"
[Alma 12:9] Alma started breaking it down: lots get the low-key secrets of God, but they're locked into only sharing what God lets them, based on how much people actually listen and put in work.
[Alma 12:10] So, if you keep your heart hard, you get a smaller slice of God's word; but stay real and open, and you level up with more truth until you unlock all God's secrets in full.
[Alma 12:11] Those who harden their hearts get only crumbs of the word, end up clueless about God's mysteries, and get snatched by the devil, dragged straight into destruction...that's the real meaning of hell's chains.
[Alma 12:12] Amulek straight-up said death's just the jump from mortal life to immortality, where we all gotta face God's court and get judged by what we did.
[Alma 12:13] So, if we stiffen up our hearts and shut out the word, to the point it's ghosted in us, our outcome's gonna be rough...we're straight-up headed for condemnation.
[Alma 12:14] Our own words and actions will drag us down, no cap; even our thoughts throw us under the bus. In that dark spot, we won't even wanna look God in the eyes...we'd low-key wish the rocks and mountains would just drop and cover us up to hide from Him.
[Alma 12:15] But no cap, we gotta show up before Him in all His glory and power, admit with eternal shame that His judgments are 100% fair, that He's just and merciful, and that He's got the mad power to save anyone who believes and actually lives that repentance life.
[Alma 12:16] Yo, here's the deal: after the first death, there's a second one...a spiritual death. Anyone who dies in their sins won't just be done physically; they're also ghosting all things righteous, spiritually dead no cap.
[Alma 12:17] That's when their pain hits max level...like an eternal lake of fire and brimstone, flames burning nonstop forever; they'll be locked down in endless destruction, all under Satan's control, trapped by his will.
[Alma 12:18] At that point, it's like redemption never happened for them...they're stuck 'cause God's justice won't flip the script; and they can't even die, since there's no decay left to break down.
[Alma 12:19] When Alma finished dropping these truths, the crowd was seriously shook, no cap.
[Alma 12:20] Then Antionah, big boss among them, stepped up like, "Wait, what? You're saying people bounce back from death and switch from mortal to immortal, with souls that never die? Say less, explain."
[Alma 12:21] He asked, "So what's good with that scripture saying God posted cherubim and a flaming sword at Eden's east side to block Adam and Eve from the tree of life, stopping them from living forever? Sounds like no shot they could've lived forever, right?"
[Alma 12:22] Alma clapped back: "Yeah, that's exactly what I was about to spill. Adam fell by eating the forbidden fruit, straight from God's word; and that fall dragged all of us into the lost and fallen squad."
[Alma 12:23] So check it, if Adam had actually eaten from the tree of life back then, death wouldn't exist, God's word would be straight-up canceled, and He'd be sus...as He said, "If you eat, you for real gonna die."
[Alma 12:24] So death hits all humans, like Amulek said...that physical dead vibe...but God gave us a window to repent; this life's the trial period, a prep phase to meet God and get ready for that eternal afterlife post-resurrection.
[Alma 12:25] Low-key, without God's OG redemption plan set since Day 1, no resurrection would pop off; but thankfully, that plan's locked in to make resurrection happen like promised.
[Alma 12:26] Real talk, if Adam and Eve had snagged the tree of life early, they'd be stuck in eternal misery with no chance to level up first; redemption's whole plan would flop, and God's word would straight up be canceled.
[Alma 12:27] But nah, it went differently...humans gotta die first; after that, they face judgment, the final call we've been talking about.
[Alma 12:28] After God set all this up for us, He realized it was only right that we actually get clued in on the stuff He planned for us.
[Alma 12:29] So God sent angels to slide into their DMs and show them His glory face-to-face.
[Alma 12:30] From then on, they started calling God's name; so He hit them back, dropping the redemption plan He prepped since Day 1, tailored to their faith, repentance, and good deeds.
[Alma 12:31] So God gave commandments after humans already broke the first rules about earthly stuff, then started flexing god-mode, knowing good and evil, free to vibe however they wanted...good or sus.
[Alma 12:32] So after revealing the redemption plan, God dropped commandments telling them to avoid evil or face a second death...eternal death from righteousness...'cause redemption can't flex there; justice stands no cap, thanks to God's supreme goodness.
[Alma 12:33] But God hit up humans in His Son's name...part of the OG redemption plan...saying: Repent and don't lock your hearts, and I'll show mercy through my Only Begotten Son.
[Alma 12:34] So anyone who bounces back and stays open-hearted locks in mercy through my Only Begotten Son, gets their sins wiped, and slides into my chill zone.
[Alma 12:35] But if you flex a hardened heart and keep doing dirt, I swear in my wrath you're not sliding into my rest...no cap.
[Alma 12:36] Yo fam, if y'all harden your hearts, no way you're entering the Lord's rest; your sins trigger Him to drop wrath like before, straight up leading to eternal soul destruction...last death for real, no cap.
[Alma 12:37] So fam, since we know this for real, let's repent and keep our hearts soft, so we don't make God unleash wrath on us again with these second commandments; instead, let's vibe in God's rest He promised.
[Alma 13:1] Yo fam, rewind to when God dropped commandments on His kids; remember He set up priests in His Son's sacred style to school the people on all this.
[Alma 13:2] These priests were decked out in His Son's style so folks could low-key catch how to vibe with the Son for redemption.
[Alma 13:3] They got ordained this way...called from the world's OG days 'cause of mad faith and deeds; first given the choice to flex good or evil, they chose good, showed next-level faith, and snagged that holy calling tied to a prep redemption plan.
[Alma 13:4] So they got this holy calling 'cause of their faith, while others stayed sus, blocking God's Spirit with stubborn hearts and blind minds...otherwise, they could've been on the same level, no cap.
[Alma 13:5] Basically, at first they were on equal footing with their crew; this holy calling was set from day one for those who kept hearts soft, all through the atonement of the Only Begotten Son, who was prepped for this.
[Alma 13:6] So they got the holy calling, ordained to the high priesthood squad of God to drop His commandments to humans, helping them vibe into His rest.
[Alma 13:7] This high priesthood rolls in His Son's style, OG from the world's start...no cap on days or years...prepped from forever to forever, thanks to God's all-knowing foresight.
[Alma 13:8] They got ordained like this...called with a holy vibe, sealed with a sacred ordinance, and took on the high priesthood of that eternal holy order, no start or finish in sight.
[Alma 13:9] So they flex as high priests forever, following the Son's eternal order...the Only Begotten of the Father, no start or end, packed with grace, fairness, and truth. And that's facts. Amen.
[Alma 13:10] Like I said, plenty got ordained into this high priesthood squad 'cause their faith and repentance were next-level, choosing to repent and do right instead of getting wrecked.
[Alma 13:11] So they got called into this holy crew, got sanctified, and their robes got that fresh white drip thanks to the Lamb's blood.
[Alma 13:12] Once sanctified by the Holy Ghost with their gear spotless and pure before God, they couldn't even glance at sin without major cringe; tons of them leveled up pure and slid into the Lord's chill zone.
[Alma 13:13] Yo, fam, humble yourselves before God and flex some real repentance fruit, so you can slide into that same rest too.
[Alma 13:14] For real, humble up like Melchizedek's crew back in the day...guy was high priest in this same endless order, owning that role forever.
[Alma 13:15] And check it, Melchizedek was the dude Abraham dropped tithes to...our OG Abraham gave up a solid tenth of all his stuff, no cap.
[Alma 13:16] These ordinances came through so folks could peep the Son of God ahead, 'cause they're basically a sneak peek of His order, helping them scope out forgiveness for their sins and slide into the Lord's rest.
[Alma 13:17] So Melchizedek was the king of Salem, but his people got mad deep in sin and gross stuff; they all went off the rails, packed with every kind of wicked vibe.
[Alma 13:18] But Melchizedek, flexing huge faith and rocking the high priesthood from God's holy order, preached repentance to his squad. They actually listened, turned it around, and he brought mad peace to the land...earning the title prince of peace while ruling Salem under his dad's watch.
[Alma 13:19] Sure, plenty came before and after him, but no one hit his level; that's why he gets the special shoutout.
[Alma 13:20] No cap, I ain't gonna replay all that; what I dropped is enough. The scriptures are right here, but if you twist them, you're just setting yourself up for a big L.
[Alma 13:21] So after Alma said all that, he threw up his hand and yelled loud AF, "Now's the moment to repent, salvation's coming in hot!"
[Alma 13:22] For real, the Lord's voice drops through angels, blasting the good news to all nations...spreading pure hype and joy...even to those scattered worldwide, which is how they ended up with us.
[Alma 13:23] The message is straight-up clear so we don't slip up, especially since we're just wandering in this strange land; low-key, we're mad blessed to have this hype news dropping everywhere in our vineyard.
[Alma 13:24] Angels are literally broadcasting this everywhere in our land right now, prepping people's hearts to catch His word when He shows up flexing His glory.
[Alma 13:25] Now we're just waiting on the angels to hype His arrival...no cap, the time's coming but who knows when. Bet I wish it dropped in my lifetime, but whether it's soon or late, I'm gonna be hyped either way.
[Alma 13:26] When He rolls up, angels will spill the tea to the righteous and holy, making sure our ancestors' prophecies come through just like they said, powered by that prophetic vibe within them.
[Alma 13:27] Yo fam, from deep in my soul...like, it hurts...I'm begging you to listen up, ditch your sins, and don't ghost on repenting later.
[Alma 13:28] Instead, flex humility before the Lord, hit up His holy name, stay woke in prayer so temptation don't clap back harder than you can handle, and vibe with the Holy Spirit to stay humble, chill, patient, loving, and mad long-suffering.
[Alma 13:29] Keep faith in the Lord, hold tight to the hope of eternal life, and keep God's love locked in your heart so you can flex at the last day and slide into His rest.
[Alma 13:30] May the Lord bless you with repentance so you dodge His wrath, skip the chains of hell, and avoid that brutal second death.
[Alma 13:31] Alma dropped even more heat on the people, but honestly, it's not all capped in this book.
[Alma 14:1] After he finished his speech, a bunch of folks caught the vibe, started repenting, and went full-on digging the scriptures.
[Alma 14:2] But most of them were fiending to cancel Alma and Amulek; they were mad salty at Alma 'cause he roasted Zeezrom hard, and they claimed Amulek was straight-up capping, throwing shade on their law and all the legal squad.
[Alma 14:3] They were still mad at Alma and Amulek, and since those two called out their dirty moves no filter, they schemed to low-key exile them.
[Alma 14:4] But nah, they didn't sneak them out; instead, they grabbed them, slapped on some heavy chains, and dragged them to the chief judge for the roast session.
[Alma 14:5] The crowd showed up to drag them, claiming they dissed the law, lawyers, judges, and everyone else; they also spilled that Alma and Amulek said there's only one God who'd send His Son but wouldn't save folks...lots of receipts against them, all in front of the chief judge.
[Alma 14:6] Zeezrom got shook hearing those truths, realized he'd blinded people with his lies, and his soul started catching major guilt vibes...like he was getting hugged hard by hell's pain circle.
[Alma 14:7] Zeezrom started confessing to the crowd, saying he's guilty and those guys are pure before God, then he tried to defend them, but they clowned him, calling him demon-possessed, spat on him, kicked him and all the believers out, then sent folks to stone them...big sus energy.
[Alma 14:8] They rounded up their wives and kids, and anyone who believed or was learning God's word got thrown into the fire; they even grabbed their scripture scrolls and chucked those flames too, trying to roast all the holy receipts.
[Alma 14:9] They dragged Alma and Amulek to the martyrdom spot so they could watch the ones getting burned up...talk about forced front-row seats to the L.
[Alma 14:10] Seeing the women and kids getting roasted tore Amulek up, and he told Alma, "How we gonna just watch this nightmare? Let's flex God's power in us and snatch them outta the fire."
[Alma 14:11] Alma hit back, "The Spirit's blocking me from stepping in; God's already flexing by taking them up, letting this happen 'cause people's hearts are hard...His wrath's gotta be fair, and the innocent blood will be receipts calling out the haters on Judgment Day."
[Alma 14:12] Amulek told Alma straight up, "Yo, maybe we're next on the fire squad."
[Alma 14:13] Alma replied, "Bet, whatever God's will is. But we're not done yet, so they ain't torching us now."
[Alma 14:14] After the fire finished its job on the bodies and scrolls, the chief judge rolled up to strapped-up Alma and Amulek, slapped their cheeks, and asked, "After all that, you still gonna preach that folks are headed for a lake of fire and brimstone?"
[Alma 14:15] The judge was like, "See? You couldn't save those thrown in the fire, and God didn't either 'cause they believed like you. What's your comeback?" Then he slapped their cheeks again, waiting on their reply.
[Alma 14:16] This judge was deep in Nehor's squad, the same dude who offed Gideon...major sus.
[Alma 14:17] Alma and Amulek stayed mute, so the judge slapped them once more and handed them over to the cops to get locked up.
[Alma 14:18] After three days locked up, a whole crowd of lawyers, judges, priests, and teachers from Nehor's crew rolled through to check on them, firing off questions, but Alma and Amulek clapped back with silence.
[Alma 14:19] The judge stepped up like, "Why you ghosting all these questions? Don't you know I can just hand you over to get burned?" He ordered them to talk, but they stayed tight-lipped.
[Alma 14:20] They dipped but bounced back the next day, and the judge slapped their cheeks again. Tons of others joined in, asking, "You gonna keep judging us and trashing our laws? If you're so powerful, why don't you just save yourselves?"
[Alma 14:21] They threw mad shade...grinding their teeth, spitting on them, and sneering, "How we supposed to flex when we're straight-up damned?"
[Alma 14:22] They kept roasting them nonstop for days, starving and dehydrating them, even stripping their clothes off so they were straight-up naked, then tied them up tight and locked them down hard.
[Alma 14:23] After days of this torture...on day twelve, month ten, year ten of the judges' reign in Nephi...the chief judge of Ammonihah rolled up with a squad of teachers and lawyers to check on Alma and Amulek still tied up in prison.
[Alma 14:24] The chief judge flexed in front of them, slapped them once more, and said, "If you've got God's power, break free from those ropes...then maybe we'll buy that the Lord's gonna wreck this people like you said."
[Alma 14:25] Everyone took turns slapping them, spitting the same shade, but after the last jab, God's power hit Alma and Amulek, and they stood up strong...clapping back with main-character energy.
[Alma 14:26] Alma shouted, "Yo Lord, how long we gotta endure this pain? Hook us up with strength based on our faith in Christ, straight to freedom." Then they snapped their cords like it was nothing, and the crowd bounced fast...fear of doom was real.
[Alma 14:27] Their fear hit so hard they dropped to the ground, couldn't even hit the prison door; then the earth shook big time and the walls split, crashing down, taking out the chief judge, lawyers, priests, and teachers who'd been slapping Alma and Amulek...they got wrecked by the fall.
[Alma 14:28] Alma and Amulek walked out the ruins unscathed...no cap, God hooked them up with power 'cause of their faith in Christ. They broke free from their bonds, and the prison collapsed, taking everyone inside except them. Then they stepped out into the city like bosses.
[Alma 14:29] The crowd heard the big ruckus and mobbed over, but when they saw Alma and Amulek stepping out of the wrecked prison, fear hit 'em hard...they bounced faster than a goat with her kids running from two lions, straight ghosting from Alma and Amulek.
[Alma 15:1] Alma and Amulek got the boot from the city, so they dipped and rolled into Sidom, where they found the OG believers from Ammonihah...straight-up exiled and stoned just for vibing with Alma's message.
[Alma 15:2] They spilled all the tea about what went down with their wives and kids, plus their own drama and how God powered their escape.
[Alma 15:3] Zeezrom was sick AF in Sidom with a savage fever, all mental stress from his messed-up guilt thinking Alma and Amulek were dead 'cause of his bad moves. His heavy sins wrecked his mind so bad he felt roasted inside with zero escape.
[Alma 15:4] When Zeezrom caught that Alma and Amulek were chilling in Sidom, his heart low-key got hope, so he slid into their DMs ASAP, asking them to come through.
[Alma 15:5] They rolled up quick after Zeezrom's invite and found him bedridden with a burning fever, mind wrecked by guilt. Seeing them, he reached out begging for a heal-up, no cap.
[Alma 15:6] Alma grabbed his hand and hit him with, "You really trust Christ's power to save, or what?"
[Alma 15:7] Zeezrom straight-up said, "Yeah, I'm down with everything you've been preaching, no cap."
[Alma 15:8] Alma was like, "If you really vibe with Christ's redemption, healing's on the table for you."
[Alma 15:9] Zeezrom replied, "Bet, I believe what you're saying, for real."
[Alma 15:10] Alma called up God, like, "Yo Lord, show this guy mercy and heal him 'cause his faith in Christ is solid."
[Alma 15:11] Right after Alma's prayer, Zeezrom bounced up, started walking, and everyone was shook. Word about this miracle spread like wildfire across Sidom.
[Alma 15:12] Alma dunked Zeezrom in water for the Lord, and from then on, Zeezrom started preaching hard to the crowd.
[Alma 15:13] Alma set up a church in Sidom, appointed priests and teachers to handle baptisms for anyone hyped to join the squad.
[Alma 15:14] Tons of people rolled in from all around Sidom, ready to get baptized and join the new wave.
[Alma 15:15] Meanwhile, the crew in Ammonihah stayed mad stubborn and cold, not owning their sins, clapping back that Alma and Amulek's power was devil stuff...real Nehor fans, no repentance vibes at all.
[Alma 15:16] So Alma and Amulek were out here, with Amulek ghosting all his gold, silver, and flexy stuff in Ammonihah for God's word, getting clapped by his old friends plus his own fam...major betrayal energy.
[Alma 15:17] After setting up the church at Sidom, Alma peeped the crowd's glow-up...people checked their pride, got humble before God, started pulling up at sanctuaries to worship, stay woke, and pray nonstop to dodge Satan, death, and all that destruction.
[Alma 15:18] So, Alma saw all this and rolled with Amulek to Zarahemla, brought him into his crib, helped him through the struggle, and boosted his vibes in the Lord.
[Alma 15:19] And just like that, the tenth year of the judges ruling the Nephites officially closed out.
[Alma 16:1] So, in year eleven of the judges' flex over the Nephites, day five of month two, Zarahemla had been chilling...no beef or drama for years...until outta nowhere, war cries popped off all over the land.
[Alma 16:2] Peep this...the Lamanite armies rolled up from the wilderness, hit the city of Ammonihah hard, started wrecking the place and taking out folks left and right.
[Alma 16:3] Before the Nephites could squad up enough to bounce the Lamanites, the invaders smashed the Ammonihah crew, wrecked spots near Noah, and snatched some people into the wilderness as captives.
[Alma 16:4] The Nephites were low-key desperate to rescue their peeps who got snatched into the wilderness.
[Alma 16:5] So, Zoram...chief captain of Nephite armies...and his sons Lehi and Aha, knowing Alma's the big priest with mad prophecy rizz, slid up to him asking where the Lord wanted them to search for their captive fam in the wilderness.
[Alma 16:6] Alma hit up the Lord for the tea, then told them straight: the Lamanites gonna cross the Sidon River in the south wilderness past Manti's borders, and that's where y'all catch them...east side of the river...and God's gonna help you snatch your captive fam back.
[Alma 16:7] So Zoram and his boys dipped across the Sidon River with their troops, marching past Manti's borders into the south wilderness on the east side of Sidon.
[Alma 16:8] They rolled up on the Lamanite armies, who got mad scattered and forced into the wilderness; they rescued every single captive brother with zero losses, bringing them back to claim their lands.
[Alma 16:9] That wraps up year eleven of the judges...Lamanites got bounced, Ammonihah was straight-up wiped out, every single Ammonihahite deleted along with their mega city they thought was too epic for God to touch.
[Alma 16:10] But check it, in just one day the place went ghost town, with bodies getting chewed up by dogs and wild beasts lurking in the wilderness.
[Alma 16:11] After a minute, the dead bodies stacked up on the ground and got covered with a thin layer, but the stench was so wild no one dared claim Ammonihah for years; they dubbed it Desolation of Nehors since those Nehor cultists got wrecked and their lands stayed ghosted.
[Alma 16:12] The Lamanites stayed MIA on the war front till year fourteen of the judges' reign, giving the Nephites three straight years of total peace vibes across the land.
[Alma 16:13] Alma and Amulek hit up the crowds preaching repentance everywhere...temples, sanctuaries, and synagogues decked out like the Jews' style, say less.
[Alma 16:14] They dropped God's word nonstop to anyone willing to listen, no cap...didn't play favorites, just straight up truth for all.
[Alma 16:15] So Alma, Amulek, and their crew of chosen ones went full send preaching everywhere, making the church glow up legit all over the Nephite lands and beyond.
[Alma 16:16] No cap, no one got side-eyed; the Lord poured His Spirit all over the land, prepping people's minds and hearts to catch the word dropping when He rolls up.
[Alma 16:17] So folks wouldn't get all sus and blocked to the word, avoiding that unbelieving L and destruction vibe...instead, they'd hype the word, get grafted like a branch into the true vine, and chill in God's rest.
[Alma 16:18] The priests came through preaching hard against all the cap...lies, scams, envy, beef, hate, trash talk, theft, murder, cheating, and all that wild sin energy, straight up saying that stuff ain't it.
[Alma 16:19] They flexed the receipts about what's about to drop soon...like the Son of God coming through, His grind of suffering and death, and the big resurrection energy after.
[Alma 16:20] Tons asked where the Son of God would show up, and they got schooled He'd roll up post-resurrection ... their reaction? Straight-up hype and mad joy.
[Alma 16:21] After the church blew up everywhere, crushed the devil's drip, with God's pure word flexed all over and blessings raining down, year fourteen of the judges' reign over the Nephites closed out like a boss.
[Alma 17:1] So Alma's trekking south from Gideon to Manti, when boom...outta nowhere, he crosses paths with Mosiah's sons rolling up towards Zarahemla, straight up mind blown.
[Alma 17:2] Mosiah's sons were OG crew when the angel showed up to Alma, so he was vibing big time to see his bros...plus they were still tight in the Lord, leveled up in truth, and had been grinding the scriptures hard to lock in God's word.
[Alma 17:3] But wait, there's more...they were on that prayer and fasting grind, so they caught the spirit of prophecy and revelation, teaching hard with straight-up God-level boss energy.
[Alma 17:4] They'd been flexing God's word for fourteen years deep in Lamanite turf, scoring mad W's by pulling tons into truth, with their words packing enough heat to get people up at God's altar confessing and calling His name.
[Alma 17:5] Their journey was no smooth vibe...they caught mad L's with body and mind suffering, dealing with hunger, thirst, fatigue, and grinding hard on that spiritual flex.
[Alma 17:6] Their moves started after saying peace out to their dad Mosiah in year one of the judges; they ghosted the throne he wanted to hand them, and low-key, the people felt the same energy.
[Alma 17:7] Still, they dipped from Zarahemla packed with swords, spears, bows, arrows, and slings...basically all the gear...so they could boss up and secure food while out in the wild.
[Alma 17:8] So they rolled out into the wilderness with their squad, aiming to hit up Nephi's land and drop the word of God on the Lamanites, no cap.
[Alma 17:9] They trekked mad days through the wild, fasting and praying hard that God'd drop some serious Spirit vibes on them to flex as His tools, hoping to pull their Lamanite bros into truth and expose the weak sauce traditions of their dads.
[Alma 17:10] Then the Lord hit them up with His Spirit like, "Chill, I got you," and straight up, they felt the comfort boost.
[Alma 17:11] God told them, "Slide into Lamanite hood, your own blood, and flex my word, but gotta stay patient through the grind and headaches, showing off that main-character energy in Me; I'll make you my ultimate tool to save mad souls."
[Alma 17:12] The sons of Mosiah and their crew caught mad courage vibes and rolled out to drop God's word on the Lamanites, no cap.
[Alma 17:13] When they hit Lamanite borders, they split up, trusting God they'd link back up after the harvest, knowing the mission they signed up for was straight-up massive.
[Alma 17:14] For real, it was huge...they aimed to preach to a savage, tough crowd who loved killing Nephites and flexing on them by looting; their hearts chased gold, silver, and jewels, but only by murder and theft, not by grinding for it themselves.
[Alma 17:15] Basically, they were mad lazy, idol-worshipping folks stuck under God's curse 'cause of their deadbeat dads' traditions, but God still hit them with promises if they'd just repent and switch up.
[Alma 17:16] That's why the sons of Mosiah took on the mission...they low-key hoped to get these guys to repent and peep the whole redemption plan.
[Alma 17:17] So they split up, rolling solo among the people, each flexing the power and word God handed them, no squad needed.
[Alma 17:18] Ammon, the main homie and their leader, blessed everyone based on their roles, dropped God's word on them, then bounced...each one heading off on their own grind across the land.
[Alma 17:19] Ammon rolled up to Ishmael's land...named after Ishmael's sons...who ended up as straight-up Lamanites.
[Alma 17:20] When Ammon pulled up in Ishmael's turf, the Lamanites caught and tied him up...standard move for any Nephite who got caught...and dragged him to the king, who could either kill him, keep him as a prisoner, toss him in jail, or just exile him, whatever flex the king wanted.
[Alma 17:21] So Ammon got paraded before King Lamoni, ruler of Ishmael's land and straight-up Ishmael's bloodline.
[Alma 17:22] The king hit up Ammon, asking if he wanted to chill with the Lamanites or bounce back to his own crew.
[Alma 17:23] Ammon was like, "Bet, I'm down to stay with these people for a minute...maybe even till I kick the bucket."
[Alma 17:24] King Lamoni was low-key vibing with Ammon, so he had his crew untie him and even wanted Ammon to marry one of his daughters...main-character moment unlocked.
[Alma 17:25] Ammon hit him with a "Nah, I'm down to serve you instead," so he became king Lamoni's servant and got posted up with the other servants guarding Lamoni's sheep...Lamanite style.
[Alma 17:26] After three days serving the king, Ammon rolled with the Lamanite servants to the water spot called Sebus, where all the Lamanites pull up with their flocks to hydrate.
[Alma 17:27] So Ammon and the king's servants were leading their flocks to the water when some other Lamanites, chilling with their own flocks, came thru and wilded out...scattering Ammon's sheep all over the place, making 'em run mad different ways.
[Alma 17:28] The king's servants started complaining, low-key scared the king would kill them like he did their bros for losing sheep 'cause of those sus guys, and they cried hard, like "Our flocks are straight up scattered already, no cap."
[Alma 17:29] They were crying 'cause they feared getting smacked down, but Ammon's heart swelled with hype...he thought, "Bet, I'll flex my skills and bring those flocks back to the king, win my squad's trust, and get them to vibe with my words."
[Alma 17:30] So Ammon was thinking all this while peeping the struggle of the crew he called his bros.
[Alma 17:31] Ammon hyped them up like, "Yo bros, chill and let's find those sheep, round 'em up, and bring 'em back to the water spot...then the king won't cap us."
[Alma 17:32] So they bounced to find the sheep, followed Ammon's lead, zoomed out fast, rounded up the king's flocks, and brought 'em all back to the water spot.
[Alma 17:33] Those same dudes tried to mess up the flocks again, but Ammon told his bros, "Lock down these sheep so they don't dip, and I'll handle these clowns causing chaos."
[Alma 17:34] So they played it Ammon's way, and he stepped up to throw down with the squad chilling by Sebus water...and they weren't exactly few, no cap.
[Alma 17:35] They weren't shook by Ammon, thinking one of their guys could bounce him whenever they wanted, 'cause they had zero clue the Lord promised Mosiah he'd keep his sons safe; they didn't even know the Lord at all, so they were hyped to wreck their own bros, which is why they kept messing with the king's sheep.
[Alma 17:36] Ammon stepped up and started chucking stones with his sling, going full beast mode and taking out a few of them, leaving 'em shook by his flex; but they got mad 'cause their bros were down, so they swore to take him out...when stones couldn't hit him, they grabbed clubs to try and cap him.
[Alma 17:37] But yo, anyone who swung a club at Ammon got their arms chopped off by his sword game; he was blocking every hit and slicing their arms clean, leaving them hella shook and running for it...no cap, it was a whole crew he sent packing with his strength.
[Alma 17:38] Six got taken down by his sling, but Ammon only sliced up their leader with his sword; he chopped off every arm that came at him...no cap, it was a whole lot.
[Alma 17:39] After he sent them packing, Ammon came back, watered the flocks, brought them to the king's pasture, then rolled up to the king with the chopped-off arms of those who tried to kill him...as straight-up receipts of what went down.
[Alma 18:1] King Lamoni made his servants step up and spill all the tea on what they peeped about the whole situation.
[Alma 18:2] After they all dropped their testimonies about what went down, and Lamoni peeped Ammon's loyalty guarding the flocks plus his savage strength takedown, he was majorly shook and said, "No cap, this ain't just a dude. Is this the Great Spirit flexing serious punishments on these killers?"
[Alma 18:3] They told the king, "No cap, we don't know if he's the Great Spirit or just a man, but what we do know is he's untouchable by the king's enemies and keeps the flocks safe with his mad skills and strength...so yeah, he's def a king's ally. For real, no human's got that kinda power 'cause we know he can't get killed."
[Alma 18:4] When the king heard that, he was like, "Bet, now I'm sure it's the Great Spirit who showed up to save your skins so I don't wipe you out like your bros. This right here is the Great Spirit our ancestors talked about."
[Alma 18:5] Lamoni's fam had the tradition that the Great Spirit was real, but even so, they thought everything they did was straight-up right; still, Lamoni started getting mad scared he might've messed up by killing his own servants.
[Alma 18:6] He'd offed a bunch of them since their bros scattered the flocks at the watering spot...so yeah, they got clapped 'cause their flocks got messed with.
[Alma 18:7] The Lamanites used to camp by the Sebus waters and mess up the flocks, hoping to bounce a bunch back to their turf...straight-up plundering was their vibe.
[Alma 18:8] King Lamoni asked his crew, "Yo, where's this dude with all that insane power at?"
[Alma 18:9] They told him, "Look, he's out here feeding your horses." The king had already told his servants to get his horses and chariots ready before watering time to roll him to Nephi for a big feast thrown by Lamoni's dad, the boss of the whole land.
[Alma 18:10] When Lamoni caught that Ammon was getting his horses and chariots ready, he was shook...no servant had shown that level of loyalty before; dude actually remembers all my orders and runs with them, no cap.
[Alma 18:11] For real, I'm convinced this is the Great Spirit, and low-key I want him to come to me, but I'm too shook to make the move.
[Alma 18:12] After Ammon prepped the horses and chariots for the king and his crew, he rolled up to the king and noticed his vibe totally switched up, so he was ready to bounce from his presence.
[Alma 18:13] One of the king's servants hits Ammon like, "Rabbanah...that means powerful or great king, since our kings flex big time...and says, 'Rabbanah, the king wants you to chill here.'"
[Alma 18:14] So Ammon faced the king and was like, "What you want me to do, king?" But the king stayed silent for like an hour...he was totally clueless on what to say.
[Alma 18:15] Ammon hit him up again, "What you really want from me?" but the king stayed ghost, no answer.
[Alma 18:16] Filled with God's Spirit, Ammon read the king's mind and said, "You trippin' 'cause you heard I defended your servants and flocks, took down seven guys with sling and sword, and chopped arms off others to protect your crew? Bet that's what's got you shook."
[Alma 18:17] I'm telling you, why you so shook? I'm just a guy and your servant, so whatever right thing you want, say less, I got you.
[Alma 18:18] The king was shook again hearing this 'cause Ammon pegged his thoughts, but still he asked straight up, "Who even are you? You the Great Spirit who knows everything?"
[Alma 18:19] Ammon clapped back, "Nah, that's not me."
[Alma 18:20] The king was like, "How you peep my heart like that? Spit it, tell me what's up, and also how you had the power to take down my bros guarding the flocks."
[Alma 18:21] Now, if you spill the tea on this, anything you want, I'll hook you up; I'd even have my armies watch your back, but I know you're way stronger than all of them...so just say what you want, I'm down.
[Alma 18:22] Ammon, smart but chill, asked Lamoni, "You gonna listen if I spill how I got this power? And that's the favor I'm gonna ask from you."
[Alma 18:23] The king said, "Bet, I'm down to believe all you say." Little did he know, he just got played.
[Alma 18:24] Ammon started flexin' bold and asked, "You really believe there's a God out there?"
[Alma 18:25] The king hit back, "Honestly, I have no clue what you're even talking about."
[Alma 18:26] Ammon kept it moving, "So, do you at least believe in the Great Spirit?"
[Alma 18:27] He straight up said, "Yeah, I do."
[Alma 18:28] Ammon said, "That's God." Then he hit him again, "You believe this Great Spirit, aka God, made everything in heaven and earth?"
[Alma 18:29] He said, "Yeah, I'm down with God making everything on Earth, but the whole heaven thing? That's still sus to me."
[Alma 18:30] Ammon was like, "Heavens? That's God's crib where all his holy angels kick it."
[Alma 18:31] King Lamoni asked, "So, it's like up above the earth, right?"
[Alma 18:32] Ammon said, "Yeah, God's up there watching over everyone, low-key knows all your thoughts and vibes since He made us from day one."
[Alma 18:33] King Lamoni was like, "No cap, I believe all that. You straight-up sent from God or what?"
[Alma 18:34] Ammon said, "I'm just a dude, but humans were made in God's image from the jump, and the Holy Spirit tapped me to drop knowledge so y'all can catch the real and righteous vibes."
[Alma 18:35] Part of that Spirit lives in me, flexing knowledge and power based on my faith and what I really want from God...no cap.
[Alma 18:36] After dropping that, Ammon started from Day 1...the world's creation, Adam's story, the fall of man...and flexed all the receipts from prophets and scriptures, even up to when Lehi dipped from Jerusalem.
[Alma 18:37] He also ran through all their ancestors' wild desert road trip...starving, thirsty, grinding through all that struggle with the king and his crew listening up.
[Alma 18:38] He spilled all the tea on Laman, Lemuel, and Ishmael's sons flipping out and rebelling, breaking down the records and scriptures from when Lehi bounced Jerusalem up to now.
[Alma 18:39] But wait, there's more...he broke down the whole redemption plan, set since Day 1, and clued them in on Christ's arrival plus all the Lord's epic moves.
[Alma 18:40] After Ammon laid out all that, the king caught the full vibe and straight-up believed every word no cap.
[Alma 18:41] Then the king hit God up like, "Yo Lord, show mercy, just like you flexed mad mercy on the Nephites...do the same for me and my squad."
[Alma 18:42] Right after saying that, he dropped to the ground like he just went full ghost mode...deadass out cold.
[Alma 18:43] So his servants scooped him up, brought him to his wife, and laid him in bed; he stayed ghosted like dead for two full days and nights, while his wife and kids...Lamanite style...were majorly grieving his loss.
[Alma 19:1] After those two days and nights, they were about to snag his body and stash it in a sepulchre they'd already set up for the dead...say less, that was the move.
[Alma 19:2] The queen caught wind of Ammon's clout, so she slid a message asking him to pull up and meet her.
[Alma 19:3] Ammon, no cap, did as told and rolled up to the queen, asking straight up what she wanted him to handle.
[Alma 19:4] She hit him with, "My husband's crew said you're a legit prophet of the holy God, flexing mad power doing all these mighty works in His name."
[Alma 19:5] So, if that's true, I want you to check on my hubby...he's been bedridden two days and nights; some say he's dead and stanky, ready for the sepulchre, but me? I don't catch that stank vibe at all.
[Alma 19:6] Ammon was low-key hyped 'cause he knew King Lamoni was in God's grip; unbelief's dark clouds were getting yeeted, and God's glory light was shining mad bright in his soul, bringing pure joy and beating his old self...he was straight up carried away by God's vibes.
[Alma 19:7] So, whatever the queen wanted was Ammon's whole vibe; he rolled up to the king like she asked, saw him, and knew straight up he wasn't dead.
[Alma 19:8] He told the queen, "Nah, he's not dead, just catching Z's in God's care, and tomorrow he'll bounce back...so don't even think about burying him."
[Alma 19:9] Ammon asked, "You really believe this?" She came back, "No receipts besides your word and the crew's, but bet...I'm trusting it's gonna go down just like you said."
[Alma 19:10] Ammon was like, "You're straight blessed for that mad faith; for real, no one in the Nephites crew has flexed faith this strong before, woman."
[Alma 19:11] So, she kept vigil over her husband's bed from then straight through till the next day when Ammon said he'd get up...no cap, she was on it.
[Alma 19:12] For real, he got up just like Ammon said; as he rose, he reached out to the woman and said, "God's name is blessed, and you're blessed too."
[Alma 19:13] "No cap, as long as you're alive, I've peeped my Redeemer who's gonna be born from a woman and save everyone who trusts His name." After saying that, his heart blew up with joy and he chilled back down, and the queen also got totally hit by the Spirit, feeling all the feels.
[Alma 19:14] Seeing the Lord's Spirit drop hard on the Lamanites...his own fam who'd caused mad grief for the Nephites and God's people 'cause of their mess-ups and old ways...Ammon dropped to his knees, pouring out his soul in prayer and hype to God, totally overwhelmed with joy; all three of them ended up flat on the ground from the feels.
[Alma 19:15] When the king's crew saw them knocked out like that, they started praying too, 'cause God's fear hit them hard...especially since they were the ones who backed Ammon up about his mad power.
[Alma 19:16] They all started calling on the Lord's name with full energy until they all crashed to the ground...except one Lamanite lady, Abish, who'd been #converted for years thanks to a wild vision her dad had.
[Alma 19:17] Low-key converted but kept it on the DL, Abish saw all Lamoni's crew, the queen, king, and Ammon all out cold and knew God's power was flexing. Thinking this moment could get people to believe, she bounced from house to house spilling the tea on what went down.
[Alma 19:18] People started rolling up to the king's crib, and to their total shock, they found the king, queen, and their crew passed out like dead, lying flat on the floor...and there was Ammon, repping the Nephites loud and clear.
[Alma 19:19] The crowd started low-key complaining, saying this was straight-up bad news for the king and his crew since he let a Nephite chill in their turf.
[Alma 19:20] But some clapped back, saying, "Nah, the king dug his own grave by killing his servants who just lost their flocks at the waters of Sebus."
[Alma 19:21] Then the guys who were at the waters of Sebus and scattered the king's flocks got called out too...they were salty at Ammon for killing so many of their crew while he was just protecting the king's sheep.
[Alma 19:22] One dude, mad 'cause Ammon killed his bro, pulled his sword to finish Ammon off, but the moment he swung, boom...he dropped dead instead.
[Alma 19:23] Turns out Ammon was untouchable...God told his dad Mosiah He'd keep him safe based on their faith, so Mosiah just trusted the whole thing to the Lord.
[Alma 19:24] When the crowd saw the guy who tried to kill Ammon just drop dead, fear hit hard...they weren't about to touch him or anyone knocked out, and they started seriously wondering what kind of mad power was going on.
[Alma 19:25] A bunch of people started saying Ammon was the Great Spirit himself, while others swore he was sent straight from the Great Spirit.
[Alma 19:26] But some clapped back hard, calling him a monster sent by the Nephites just to mess with them.
[Alma 19:27] Some said Ammon was actually sent by the Great Spirit to punish them for their sins, 'cause the Great Spirit's always had the Nephites' back and kept saving them...like, this same power wiped out tons of Lamanite homies before.
[Alma 19:28] The vibe totally escalated into full-on beef among the crowd, and the servant girl who got everyone there pulled up...seeing all that drama hit her deep, straight-up crying over the chaos.
[Alma 19:29] She grabbed the queen's hand to lift her up, and as soon as she did, the queen stood up and yelled out, "O blessed Jesus, who saved me from straight-up hell! O blessed God, have mercy on these people!"
[Alma 19:30] After that, she clasped her hands, vibing on so much joy she started spitting words no one really got; then she grabbed King Lamoni's hand, and just like that, he popped up and stood solid.
[Alma 19:31] Right away, Lamoni saw the crowd beefing and stepped in to clap back, dropping the knowledge he caught from Ammon; anyone who listened ended up believing and got converted to the Lord, no cap.
[Alma 19:32] Still, plenty of peeps just tuned him out and bounced, no cap.
[Alma 19:33] When Ammon stood up, he started serving them too, and all Lamoni's crew did the same; everyone was preaching the same vibe...that their hearts flipped and they no longer wanted to do bad stuff.
[Alma 19:34] Check it, tons claimed they saw angels IRL and chatted with them, spilling tea about God and His mad righteous ways.
[Alma 19:35] So, plenty bought into their story and got baptized; they leveled up into a righteous squad and set up their own church vibes.
[Alma 19:36] That's how the Lord's hustle started with the Lamanites, pouring out His Spirit on 'em...God's reach is wide open for anyone ready to repent and believe in His name.
[Alma 20:1] After setting up church there, King Lamoni wanted Ammon to roll with him back to Nephi's land to flex him to his dad.
[Alma 20:2] God hit up Ammon with the message: don't slide into Nephi's land 'cause the king's out for your neck; instead, bounce to Middoni where your bro Aaron and Muloki plus Ammah are locked up.
[Alma 20:3] When Ammon got the memo, he told Lamoni straight up: my bro and the crew are stuck in Middoni jail, so I'm heading there to break 'em out.
[Alma 20:4] Lamoni told Ammon, "I got that you can crush it with God's power, but I'm rolling with you to Middoni since their king, Antiomno, is my homie...I'll flex on him so he frees your bros. Wait, who spilled the tea about your bros being locked up?"
[Alma 20:5] Ammon clapped back, "No one told me but God Himself; He said, 'Go rescue your bros...they're locked up in Middoni's prison.'"
[Alma 20:6] When Lamoni heard that, he told his squad to prep the horses and chariots ASAP.
[Alma 20:7] Lamoni said to Ammon, "Let's bounce to Middoni together; I'll talk up the king to free your bros from jail."
[Alma 20:8] So, while Ammon and Lamoni were cruising to Middoni, they ran into Lamoni's dad, the big boss king over the whole land.
[Alma 20:9] Lamoni's dad hit him with, "Yo, why'd you ghost the big feast I threw for my sons and the squad that epic day?"
[Alma 20:10] He also snapped, "Where you headed with this Nephite dude, a straight-up child of a liar?"
[Alma 20:11] Lamoni spilled where he was headed, low-key scared to catch any beef from his dad.
[Alma 20:12] He also clued him in on why he was chillin' in his own kingdom and bailed on rolling to his dad's feast.
[Alma 20:13] After Lamoni spilled all the tea, his dad flipped, yelling, "Lamoni, you're trying to save these Nephites...straight-up kids of a liar who robbed our dads. Now their crew's here, tryna scam us again and jack our stuff with their sneaky lies."
[Alma 20:14] Lamoni's dad straight-up ordered him to off Ammon with the sword and said, "No Middoni trip...bounce back with me to Ishmael."
[Alma 20:15] Lamoni clapped back, "Nah, I'm not killing Ammon or heading back to Ishmael. I'm rolling to Middoni to free Ammon's bros 'cause I know they're legit righteous prophets of the real God."
[Alma 20:16] When his dad heard that, he got mad AF and pulled his sword, ready to slam Lamoni down hard.
[Alma 20:17] Ammon stepped up, saying, "Yo, don't kill your son; honestly, it'd be worse if he fell than you, since he's actually repented. But if you pop off now in rage, you're straight risking your soul, no cap."
[Alma 20:18] Plus, you gotta hold back...killing your innocent son would make his blood scream to God for revenge, and you might straight-up lose your soul over this.
[Alma 20:19] After Ammon dropped that wisdom, his dad replied, "I get it, killing my son would be innocent bloodshed; and honestly, you're the one trying to take him out."
[Alma 20:20] He lunged to kill Ammon, but Ammon blocked the hits and clapped his arm so hard it was useless.
[Alma 20:21] When the king realized Ammon could take him out, he started begging Ammon to chill and spare his life.
[Alma 20:22] Ammon lifted his sword and said, "I'm about to clobber you unless you let my brothers out of prison, no cap."
[Alma 20:23] Scared for his life, the king said, "Spare me and I'll give you anything you want...even half the kingdom, bet."
[Alma 20:24] Ammon saw the old king was playing ball, so he said, "Let my brothers outta jail, keep Lamoni's throne safe, and don't come at him...let him do his thing...and I'll spare you. Otherwise, you're getting wrecked."
[Alma 20:25] After Ammon laid down those terms, the king started vibing hard, hyped he wasn't getting clipped.
[Alma 20:26] Seeing Ammon wasn't out to end him and that he had mad love for Lamoni, the king was shook and said, "Since all you want is my bros freed and my son's kingdom safe, bet...I'm letting Lamoni keep his throne forever, and I'm stepping back from running things."
[Alma 20:27] I'm also letting your bros out of jail so y'all can roll through my kingdom...I'm low-key hyped to see you. The king was shook by what Ammon and Lamoni said and got mad curious to learn more.
[Alma 20:28] Ammon and Lamoni rolled out toward Middoni, and Lamoni caught mad favor with that land's king, so Ammon's bros got straight-up freed from prison.
[Alma 20:29] When Ammon finally linked up with his bros, he was low-key devastated...these dudes were practically naked, skin wrecked from tight ropes, mad hungry, thirsty, and dealing with all kinds of pain, yet still chill and patient through it all.
[Alma 20:30] These bros got caught by some extra stubborn folks who ghosted their words, beat them up, and tossed them from house to house until Middoni. There they got locked up tight for days, but Lamoni and Ammon came through and busted them out.
[Alma 21:1] When Ammon and his bros split near Lamanite territory, Aaron dipped toward the land the Lamanites called Jerusalem...named after their OG homeland...and it was close to the edges of Mormon's turf.
[Alma 21:2] The Lamanites, Amalekites, and Amulon's crew teamed up and built a huge city called Jerusalem.
[Alma 21:3] The Lamanites were already pretty sus, but Amalekites and Amulonites were even more hardened, pushing the Lamanites to toughen up their hearts and level up in wickedness and straight-up abominations.
[Alma 21:4] Aaron rolled up to Jerusalem and started preaching to the Amalekites in their synagogues, which were built following Nehor's vibe...since a lot of Amalekites and Amulonites were repping that Nehor crew.
[Alma 21:5] So Aaron steps into a synagogue to preach, and outta nowhere an Amalekite pops off, throwing shade like, "What receipts you got? Seen an angel? Why ain't angels showing up for us? Aren't we just as valid as your crew?"
[Alma 21:6] He clapped back, "You say we gotta repent or we're toast, but how you know what's really in our hearts? What proof we gotta repent or that we ain't righteous? We got our sanctuaries, squad up to worship God, and believe He saves everyone...say less."
[Alma 21:7] Aaron hit him with, "You really believe the Son of God's gonna slide through and save everyone from their sins?"
[Alma 21:8] The dude snapped back, "We don't buy that you know any of that info. These traditions? Straight-up dumb. We don't believe you or our folks knew jack about future stuff they were talking about."
[Alma 21:9] Aaron started dropping knowledge from the scriptures about Christ's coming, the dead rising, and that no one gets redeemed unless Christ goes through death, suffering, and blood atonement...say less, that's the real deal.
[Alma 21:10] As Aaron laid out these truths, the crowd got mad, threw shade, and straight-up ignored his words...major L vibes.
[Alma 21:11] Seeing no one was catching his drift, Aaron dipped from their synagogue and rolled to Ani-Anti, where Muloki, Ammah, and the squad were preaching and debating the word hard.
[Alma 21:12] They peeped the crowd was low-key heartless, so they bounced to Middoni, preached the word to a bunch, but only a handful vibed and believed their message.
[Alma 21:13] Still, Aaron and some bros got snatched and thrown in jail, while the rest dipped from Middoni to the nearby spots to avoid the heat.
[Alma 21:14] The jailed crew took mad L's but got rescued by Lamoni and Ammon, who hooked them up with food and fresh fits.
[Alma 21:15] After that, they bounced back to spread the word, getting out of jail for the first time...and yeah, they had taken their share of hits.
[Alma 21:16] They rolled wherever the Spirit of the Lord flexed, preaching God's word in every Amalekite synagogue and any Lamanite gathering that let them slide.
[Alma 21:17] God started blessing their hustle big time, turning tons onto the truth, making them realize their sins and the bogus traditions their ancestors were stuck on.
[Alma 21:18] Ammon and Lamoni bounced back from Middoni to their home turf, the land of Ishmael...their OG inheritance spot.
[Alma 21:19] King Lamoni was straight-up no cap about not letting Ammon be his servant or do his bidding.
[Alma 21:20] Still, Lamoni had synagogues built all over Ishmael and got his crew to squad up and gather under his rule.
[Alma 21:21] Lamoni hyped them up, schooled them hard, and flexed that they were his people...free from his dad the king's oppressions...since his dad legit gave him the plug to rule Ishmael and the surrounding lands.
[Alma 21:22] He also told them straight up they could worship the Lord however they wanted, anywhere in King Lamoni's turf...no cap on their freedom.
[Alma 21:23] Ammon preached to King Lamoni's people, dropping full-on lessons about righteousness every day; they actually listened up and got mad hyped to keep God's commandments.
[Alma 22:1] While Ammon was grinding with Lamoni's crew nonstop, Aaron and his squad bounced from Middoni, Spirit-led straight to Nephi...the king's crib who ran all the land except Ishmael, and that king was Lamoni's dad.
[Alma 22:2] So Aaron and his bros rolled up to the king's palace, bowed down, and said, "Yo king, we're Ammon's squad...you know, the dude you freed from prison."
[Alma 22:3] Aaron told the king, "If you don't end us, we'll serve you." The king was like, "Get up, you're safe...but you won't be my servants; you'll serve me instead. I'm low-key stressed over how lit your brother Ammon's words were and wanna know why he ghosted Middoni without you."
[Alma 22:4] Aaron said, "The Lord's Spirit rerouted him; Ammon dipped to Ishmael to school Lamoni's people instead."
[Alma 22:5] The king was like, "Wait, what's this about the Spirit of the Lord? That's the real sus thing stressing me out."
[Alma 22:6] Then he asked, "Also, what's up with Ammon saying, 'Repent and you're saved, don't and you're ghosted on Judgment Day'?"
[Alma 22:7] Aaron asked, "You believe in God?" The king said, "I know the Amalekites say there's a God, and I even let them build sanctuaries to squad up and worship. If you're telling me God's real, say less...I'm down to believe."
[Alma 22:8] Aaron's heart went full hype and he said, "No cap, as you live, king, God is 100% real."
[Alma 22:9] The king asked, "Is God the Great Spirit who led our ancestors outta Jerusalem?"
[Alma 22:10] Aaron said, "Yeah, He's that Great Spirit who made everything in heaven and earth. You believe that?"
[Alma 22:11] He replied, "For sure, I trust the Great Spirit made everything, so spill the tea on all this and I'm ready to vibe with your words."
[Alma 22:12] When Aaron peeped that the king was down to believe, he started from Adam's creation, dropping scriptures about how God made humans in His image, gave commandments, and how sin made us fall.
[Alma 22:13] Aaron broke down the scriptures from Adam's start, flexing the fall, our messy state, and the OG redemption plan set since day one via Christ...for anyone who vibes with His name.
[Alma 22:14] Since humans fell, they can't earn shit alone; but Christ's sufferings and death cover their sins if they have faith and repent. He breaks death's chains, so the grave ain't winning, and death's sting gets iced out by hope for glory...Aaron laid all this out to the king.
[Alma 22:15] After Aaron schooled him, the king was like, "Say less, how do I score this eternal life? How do I get born of God, boot this wicked spirit, cop His Spirit for mad joy, and avoid getting ghosted on Judgment Day? Bet, I'll drop all my stuff and even my kingdom just to catch that vibe."
[Alma 22:16] Aaron said, "If you really want this, just bow to God, repent all your sins, call on His name with faith knowing you'll get it...then you'll catch that hope you're after."
[Alma 22:17] When Aaron dropped those words, the king went full humble mode...knees down, face to the ground, straight-up balling out loud.
[Alma 22:18] The king cried, "God, Aaron said you're real; if that's true and you're the One, show up for me...I'll dump all my sins just to know you, get resurrected, and be saved on judgment day." Then boom, he went stone-cold like he was dead.
[Alma 22:19] His crew dashed to spill the tea to the queen about the king's situation. She rolled up, saw him lying like a corpse and Aaron with his squad standing there looking sus, got mad, and ordered her peeps to snuff them out.
[Alma 22:20] The servants peeped why the king dropped, so they weren't about to touch Aaron and his crew. They begged the queen like, "Why kill these guys when one of them's straight-up stronger than all of us? We'd just get wrecked."
[Alma 22:21] Seeing her servants shook, the queen got mad scared too, worried some bad vibes might hit her. So she ordered them to rally the crowd to take down Aaron and his crew.
[Alma 22:22] Aaron caught the queen's savage mood and knew the people's hearts were hella stubborn, so he feared a wild riot might pop off. He reached out, lifted the king up, and said, "Stand." The king got up, powered up, no cap.
[Alma 22:23] This went down right in front of the queen and her crew. They saw it, straight-up shook and started catching mad fear. The king then stepped up, preaching hard, and low-key converted his whole squad to the Lord.
[Alma 22:24] The queen's order pulled a whole crowd, and the mood got hella sus with people low-key complaining about Aaron and his crew.
[Alma 22:25] The king stepped in, dropped some truth, and chilled the crowd out...everyone cooled off toward Aaron and his squad.
[Alma 22:26] Once the king peeped that the crowd was vibing peaceful, he had Aaron and his bros step up front and preach the word right to the masses.
[Alma 22:27] The king sent out a major broadcast across his whole land and the surrounding spots...from the east sea to the west, with that skinny wilderness strip splitting it from Zarahemla, running along the seashore and Manti by the Sidon river...basically marking the divide between Lamanites and Nephites, no cap.
[Alma 22:28] The lazier Lamanites camped out wild in tents all over the wilderness west side...in Nephi's land, west of Zarahemla by the shore, holding onto their OG fam's old turf along the coast.
[Alma 22:29] Tons of Lamanites were chillin' on the east coast after the Nephites pushed them there, so the Nephites were basically boxed in. Still, they held the northern zone by the wilderness near the Sidon river, stretching east to west up to the land named Bountiful.
[Alma 22:30] That spot touched the land called Desolation, way up north where peeps once lived but got wrecked...bones and all, as we said...discovered by Zarahemla's crew, which was their first touchdown zone.
[Alma 22:31] They moved from there into the southern wilderness, so the north land got dubbed Desolation, and the south land, Bountiful...packed with all kinds of wild animals, some even coming down from the north hunting for food.
[Alma 22:32] From Bountiful to Desolation, a Nephite could make the trek coast-to-coast in a day and a half. So basically, Nephi and Zarahemla lands were almost surrounded by water, only separated by a skinny neck of land north to south.
[Alma 22:33] The Nephites set up camp in Bountiful coast-to-coast, and with their squads and armies, they boxed in the Lamanites from the south so these guys couldn't snag any more northern turf or run wild up north.
[Alma 22:34] So the Lamanites were stuck only in Nephi land and nearby wilderness...smart move by the Nephites to keep their enemies contained and avoid constant drama, while still letting the Lamanites have a place to dip to if they wanted.
[Alma 22:35] Alright, after dropping all that, I'm sliding back to the saga of Ammon, Aaron, Omner, Himni, and their crew.
[Alma 23:1] Peep this: the Lamanite king dropped a decree telling everyone to keep their hands off Ammon, Aaron, Omner, Himni, and their squad preaching God's word anywhere in their territory...no cap.
[Alma 23:2] For real, he ordered no binding, jailing, spitting, smacking, kicking out of synagogues, whipping, or stone-throwing at them; instead, they had full-on VIP access to homes, temples, and sacred spots.
[Alma 23:3] So these preachers could flex their message freely 'cause the king and his whole fam turned to the Lord, dropping a decree so God's word faces zero cap blocks...waking their people up to how sus their ancestors' bad habits were, reminding them they're all fam and should quit with murder, theft, adultery, and all that wicked vibe.
[Alma 23:4] After the king dropped that proclamation, Aaron and his crew bounced city to city, hitting up churches, appointing priests and teachers all over Lamanite land to preach and teach God's word...and low-key, they started crushing it.
[Alma 23:5] Straight up, thousands got woke to the Lord, thousands hopped on the Nephite tradition train, and they got schooled on the records and prophecies passed down till now.
[Alma 23:6] No cap, as long as the Lord lives, everyone who got woke through Ammon and his squad's preaching...backed by prophecy, revelation, and God's miracle flex...who believed and switched up, never dipped or backtracked.
[Alma 23:7] They leveled up into a righteous squad, dropped the rebellion hardware, and quit beefing with God or their own peeps for good.
[Alma 23:8] So these folks? They're the ones who made the upgrade and converted to the Lord.
[Alma 23:9] The Lamanite crew chilling in the land of Ishmael, no cap.
[Alma 23:10] Plus the Lamanite squad repping the land of Middoni, straight up.
[Alma 23:11] And don't forget the Lamanite crew holding it down in the city of Nephi, say less.
[Alma 23:12] Also, the Lamanite peeps living in Shilom, Shemlon, Lemuel, and Shimnilom...they're all in the mix.
[Alma 23:13] These Lamanite cities went full send converting to the Lord, dropped all their rebellion gear...no cap, every weapon laid down...and yeah, they were all Lamanites.
[Alma 23:14] The Amalekites were all sus, only one switched up; Amulonites nope, just heartless bots who also brainwashed the Lamanites around them in every village and city.
[Alma 23:15] So yeah, we dropped the receipts on all the Lamanite cities where folks repented, caught the truth vibe, and converted.
[Alma 23:16] So the king and his converted crew wanted a sick name to flex their new vibe and stand out from their fam; he hit up Aaron and the priests for the perfect tag to rep.
[Alma 23:17] They locked in the name Anti-Nephi-Lehies and ditched the Lamanite tag for good...new name, new squad energy.
[Alma 23:18] They started grinding hard, vibing friendly with the Nephites, slid into their DMs with correspondence, and the God curse bounced off them for real.
[Alma 24:1] So, the Amalekites, Amulonites, and Lamanites across Amulon, Helam, Jerusalem, basically all around, who ghosted the Anti-Nephi-Lehi squad, got hyped up mad salty by the Amalekites and Amulonites against their own fam.
[Alma 24:2] Their hate went full savage, even flipping on their own king and canceling his reign, then flexing weapons against the Anti-Nephi-Lehi squad.
[Alma 24:3] The king passed the crown to his son, who he named Anti-Nephi-Lehi...main character energy unlocked.
[Alma 24:4] That same year the Lamanites started gearing up for war on God's squad, the king died...no cap, timing was wild.
[Alma 24:5] When Ammon, his bros, and the crew peeped the Lamanites prepping to wreck their fam, they pulled up to Midian, linked up with all the squad, then rolled to Ishmael to huddle with Lamoni and his bro Anti-Nephi-Lehi to plot their defense moves.
[Alma 24:6] Not a single converted soul was about to flex weapons on their own fam; no prepping for war either, 'cause even their king said "say less" to fighting.
[Alma 24:7] The king hit the crowd with this: big ups to God for blessing us with the Nephites, dropping truth bombs and waking us up from our sketchy ancestors' vibes.
[Alma 24:8] Low-key, I gotta thank God for flexing some Spirit on us, softening our hearts so we could slide into correspondence with the Nephite fam.
[Alma 24:9] Also, mad respect to God 'cause through this link-up, we finally caught receipts on our sins and the mad murders we pulled.
[Alma 24:10] Big shoutout to my great God for letting us come clean, forgiving our messy sins and killings, and wiping the guilt off our hearts through his Son's epic mercy.
[Alma 24:11] Yo, my bros, since we were peak lost in sin and murder, repenting was all we had energy for, just hoping God would ghost our stains from our hearts...barely made the cut.
[Alma 24:12] Alright, fam, since God wiped our stains and our swords are shining, let's not flex on our own crew with bloodshed anymore...peace over clout.
[Alma 24:13] Listen up, nope...keep your swords clean, no blood on our fam; if we mess up again, even the Son's blood can't clean that mess...say less.
[Alma 24:14] Big God showed mad mercy, dropping these truths so we don't get wiped out; he's got love for our souls like his own kids, sending angels to keep the salvation plan 100 for us and the future squad.
[Alma 24:15] Yo, God's mad merciful! Since scrubbing our stains was all we could handle and our swords are shining, let's stash them clean as a receipt for the last day when we flex before Him...proving we didn't stain our swords with our own fam's blood after His word cleaned us up.
[Alma 24:16] So fam, if our own try to cancel us, we're gonna stash those swords deep and spotless as proof we never clapped back; and if they do take us out, we're heading to God for the ultimate W, no cap.
[Alma 24:17] When the king dropped his speech and everyone was vibing, they grabbed all the swords and weapons used for human beef and straight-up buried that drama deep underground.
[Alma 24:18] They did this as a straight-up flex to God and the squad...swearing no more blood on their hands; they pledged they'd rather die than hurt their bros, give instead of take, and grind hard instead of chilling lazy.
[Alma 24:19] So yeah, when the Lamanites caught the real truth, they stood solid, ready to catch an L over sinning; they buried their war gear low for the vibe of peace.
[Alma 24:20] Meanwhile, their Lamanite bros geared up for war, rolling into Nephi to cancel the king, flex a new boss, and wipe out the Anti-Nephi-Lehi squad from the land.
[Alma 24:21] When the people saw the Lamanites rolling up, they went out, hit the ground praying hard to the Lord, and were still like that when the Lamanites started swinging swords on them.
[Alma 24:22] So without any pushback, the Lamanites clapped 1,005 of them; but no cap, those fallen are blessed, now vibing forever with God.
[Alma 24:23] When the Lamanites peeped that their own wouldn't ghost the sword or dodge left or right, but instead just accepted their fate and even hyped God while going down...big mood.
[Alma 24:24] Seeing this, the Lamanites held back from clapping more; mad of them felt shook for their fallen bros and started rethinking their whole vibe.
[Alma 24:25] They dropped their war gear for good, no receipts of picking them back up...low-key shook over their past kills...and came down chill like their bros, hoping for mercy from those ready to clap them.
[Alma 24:26] That day, God's crew got bigger than the number who caught L's, and since the fallen were legit righteous, we're sure they snagged that salvation, no cap.
[Alma 24:27] No evil folks got clipped, but over a thousand got woke to the real truth...proof God's always flexing different moves to save His peeps.
[Alma 24:28] Low-key, most of the Lamanites who clapped their own were Amalekites and Amulonites, mostly rolling with the Nehor crew's vibes.
[Alma 24:29] Among the new joiners to God's squad, none were Amalekites, Amulonites, or Nehor stans...just legit descendants of Laman and Lemuel, no cap.
[Alma 24:30] So for real, once a squad's been woke by God's Spirit and schooled in righteousness, but then dips into sin, they get way more hardened...basically worse off than if they'd never caught the vibe to begin with.
[Alma 25:1] So, those Lamanites got mad salty about clapping their own and swore revenge on the Nephites, but they chilled and didn't try to mess with Anti-Nephi-Lehi squad again then.
[Alma 25:2] Instead, they flexed their armies, bounced to Zarahemla's borders, and straight up wrecked the folks chilling in Ammonihah.
[Alma 25:3] After that, they caught mad L's in battles with the Nephites, getting pushed back and taken out left and right.
[Alma 25:4] Almost all the killed Lamanites were straight-up the kids of Amulon and his bros, Noah's priests, and the Nephites handled that cleanup no cap.
[Alma 25:5] The rest dipped into the east wilderness, hijacked the Lamanite power, and low-key made tons of their own catch L's by burning 'em for their beliefs.
[Alma 25:6] After catching mad L's and suffering hard, a bunch got hit with vibes from Aaron and crew's preachings, started ghosting their dad's old traditions, and clowned in the Lord's power with the Nephites...so many flipped their script in the wilderness.
[Alma 25:7] Then the last Amulon kid bosses made sure everyone vibing with that faith got clapped...deadass killed all the believers.
[Alma 25:8] Those martyr deaths got their own squad heated, sparking mad beef in the wilderness; the Lamanites started hunting Amulon's crew's kids and clapped 'em, so they bounced to the east wilderness.
[Alma 25:9] Even now, the Lamanites still hunt them down...Abinadi's prophecy about those priests' kids who got him fried is straight facts.
[Alma 25:10] He told them straight up: what y'all do to me is a preview of the drip coming down the line.
[Alma 25:11] Abinadi was the OG burned for reppin' God, meaning plenty more would catch that same fiery L like he did.
[Alma 25:12] He told Noah's priest squad their kids would make many get clapped like him and get scattered and hunted like lost sheep getting eaten by wild beasts...and guess what, Lamanites came through with the receipts, driving, hunting, and beatin' them down.
[Alma 25:13] When the Lamanites peeped they couldn't flex on the Nephites, they bounced back home, and a bunch actually moved into Ishmael and Nephi's turf, linking up with God's squad...the Anti-Nephi-Lehies.
[Alma 25:14] They tossed their war gear underground like their fam, started rocking that righteous vibe, walking God's path tight and keeping His rules on lock.
[Alma 25:15] Yeah, they stuck to Moses' law since it wasn't fully done yet. But low-key, they were hyped for Christ's arrival, knowing Moses' law was just a sneak peek, so they kept the rituals on deck until Jesus showed up.
[Alma 25:16] They weren't fooled thinking Moses' law was the key to salvation; instead, it leveled up their faith in Christ, keeping their hope alive for eternal W's, all while vibing with prophecy's sneak peeks.
[Alma 25:17] Yo, Ammon, Aaron, Omner, Himni, and their crew were hyped AF about their wins with the Lamanites, seeing God answer their prayers and drop receipts on every promise.
[Alma 26:1] Ammon hit up his squad like, "Fam, real talk...how wild is it that when we dipped from Zarahemla, we even imagined God would bless us this hard? Big reason to flex and rejoice."
[Alma 26:2] So fr, what major blessings has He dropped on us? Can y'all even name 'em?
[Alma 26:3] I got you...our Lamanite fam was stuck in deep dark vibes, but now mad of them are catching God's epic light. That's the real flex: we're God's tools making this big glow-up happen.
[Alma 26:4] Yo, thousands are out here vibin', rejoicing, and straight-up joining God's squad.
[Alma 26:5] Look, the field was mad ready, and y'all got blessed for swinging that sickle hard all day, grinding nonstop; peep the massive harvest you bagged...no cap, those sheaves are gonna be stored safe, no losses.
[Alma 26:6] For real, they won't get wrecked by the end-times storm or torn up by wild winds; when the chaos hits, they'll be chillin' safe in their spot, no way the storm or enemy vibes can mess with them or drag them around.
[Alma 26:7] But real talk, they're all in the Lord of the harvest's hands...His crew...and He's gonna pull them up big time on the last day.
[Alma 26:8] Blessed be God's name, frfr; let's throw a praise party and thank His holy name 'cause He's out here grinding righteousness 24/7, no cap.
[Alma 26:9] Low-key, if we hadn't bounced from Zarahemla, our ride-or-die brehs who love us madly would still be caught up in hating us, and straight-up strangers to God's vibe.
[Alma 26:10] So after Ammon flexed like that, Aaron hit him with a reality check, saying, "Ammon, fr, I'm low-key worried your hype is turning into straight-up bragging."
[Alma 26:11] Ammon clapped back, "Bruh, I ain't flexing on my own power or smarts; nah, my heart's just overflowing with mad joy, and I'm hyped to rejoice in my God."
[Alma 26:12] Yeah, I get it...I'm basically nothing and low-key weak, so I ain't gonna flex on myself, but I'll rizz up my God 'cause with His strength I'm unstoppable; for real, we pulled off mad miracles here, so His name gets all the praise forever.
[Alma 26:13] Yo, peep how many thousands of our brehs He freed from hell's clutch, now they're singing that redeeming love anthem...all thanks to His word working through us; like, how could we not be hype about that?
[Alma 26:14] No doubt, we gotta praise Him forever, 'cause He's the Most High God who broke our brehs outta hell's chains, no cap.
[Alma 26:15] They were trapped in endless darkness and doom, but He pulled them into His eternal light and salvation, wrapped tight in His next-level love; and guess what? We're just His tools, making this epic work happen.
[Alma 26:16] So yeah, we're gonna flex on the Lord hard, rejoice till our joy's maxed, and praise God forever. Like, who's gonna ever get tired of hyping His power, mercy, and endless patience with us? Honestly, I can't even put into words how deep my feels go.
[Alma 26:17] Who would've thought God would be this clutch, pulling us outta our nasty, sinful mess with mad mercy?
[Alma 26:18] Yo, we actually rolled up mad salty, straight threatening to wipe out His church with full force.
[Alma 26:19] So like, why didn't He just hit us with full-on destruction, let His justice sword drop, and lock us in eternal doom?
[Alma 26:20] My soul legit freaks out just thinking about it...He didn't hit us with justice but, with mad mercy, carried us over that endless pit of death and misery straight into soul-saving vibes.
[Alma 26:21] Look, fam, who out here really gets this? Honestly, only the ones low-key humble and sorry for their mess can vibe with these truths.
[Alma 26:22] Bet, if someone's truly repentant, flexes faith, drops good deeds, and prays nonstop, God spills His secrets to them...stuff never seen before...and they get the power to turn thousands back, just like we did with our brehs.
[Alma 26:23] Yo, fam, remember when we told the Zarahemla crew we were heading to Nephi to preach to the Lamanites, and they straight-up laughed us off like it was a joke?
[Alma 26:24] They were like, "You really think you can wake up the Lamanites to the truth? Convince these stubborn, bloodthirsty folks who've been wildin' in sin since forever?" And yeah, my brehs, that's exactly what they said.
[Alma 26:25] Plus, they were all like, "Let's grab weapons and wipe them and their mess out before they come at us and wreck us."
[Alma 26:26] But check it, my beloved brehs, we rolled into the wilderness not to beef or destroy, but hoping to save a few souls instead.
[Alma 26:27] When we were lowkey ready to quit, God hit us with the ultimate vibe check: "Go back to the Lamanites, chill through the struggle, and I'll hook you up with that W."
[Alma 26:28] So here we are, living among them, grinding through every struggle, bouncing house to house, leaning not just on worldly kindness but straight-up trusting God's mercy too.
[Alma 26:29] We rolled into their homes, streets, hills, even their temples and synagogues to teach, but got bounced, mocked, spat on, slapped, stoned, tied up, and thrown in jail...yet God's power and wisdom pulled us out every single time.
[Alma 26:30] We took every L on the chin, all in hopes of saving even just one soul, thinking our happiness would be next-level if we pulled that off.
[Alma 26:31] Look, we can peep the glow-up from our grind, and it's no small flex...tons of souls changed, proof in their genuine love for their brehs and even us.
[Alma 26:32] For real, they'd rather die than kill their enemy, and they straight-up buried their war gear underground, all 'cause they love their brehs that much.
[Alma 26:33] So, I gotta ask...has this kind of love ever popped off this hard anywhere else? Nah, not even among the Nephites.
[Alma 26:34] See, they used to throw hands at their own fam, never down to get killed...yet now so many have died for the cause, and we know they're chillin' with God thanks to their love and pure beef against sin.
[Alma 26:35] Don't we have every reason to flex with joy? Straight up, no one's ever had this much hype since day one; my joy's so real I gotta brag on God...He's got the ultimate power, wisdom, and mercy waiting to save anyone who reps repentance and believes in His name.
[Alma 26:36] If that's flexing, then bet...I'll flex all day, 'cause God's my life, light, joy, salvation, and my ticket outta eternal drag; mad respect to Him for remembering His people, a lost branch of Israel stuck in a weird place...blessed be His name for watching over us lost wanderers.
[Alma 26:37] Yo fam, God's got receipts on every squad no matter where they're at; He counts His people and His mercy low-key covers the whole planet. That's my vibe and gratitude...forever thanking God, no cap. Amen.
[Alma 27:1] So, the Lamanites who tried clapping the Nephites realized their grind was straight-up pointless, so they bounced back to the land of Nephi.
[Alma 27:2] The Amalekites got mad salty over their L, and when they couldn't clap back at the Nephites, they started stirring drama, hyping up hate against their own fam, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies, and jumped back on the destroy mode.
[Alma 27:3] These folks stayed firm, saying nope to weapons, just letting their enemies do their worst and get slain without throwing hands.
[Alma 27:4] When Ammon and his crew saw their beloved getting wrecked...people treating them like god-sent angels saving them from eternal doom...they got hit with mad feels and told the king straight up.
[Alma 27:5] Let's squad up God's people and dip to Zarahemla to link with our Nephite fam, escaping our haters so we don't get wiped out.
[Alma 27:6] But the king hit them with, "Yo, Nephites gonna roast us for all the killings and sins we pulled on them."
[Alma 27:7] Ammon was like, "I'll check with God, and if He says bounce to our fam, y'all down to roll?"
[Alma 27:8] The king said, "Bet, if God says go, we'll slide to our fam and even be their slaves till we fix all the murders and sins we did them."
[Alma 27:9] Ammon clapped back, "Our fam's law ... set by my dad ... ain't about having slaves, so let's roll and trust in our brothers' mercy instead."
[Alma 27:10] The king said, "Check with God, and if He says bounce, we bounce; if not, we're straight-up doomed here."
[Alma 27:11] So Ammon slid up to God for the tea, and God hit him back with the answer.
[Alma 27:12] God said, "Pull these people outta here so they don't get yeeted; Satan's got the Amalekites twisted, hyping the Lamanites to savage their own bros. So bounce now...this generation's blessed, I got them on lock."
[Alma 27:13] Ammon bounced back and spilled all the Lord's words straight to the king.
[Alma 27:14] They rounded up all God's people, packed their flocks and herds, dipped from their land, and rolled into the wilderness between Nephi and Zarahemla, pulling up near the border.
[Alma 27:15] Ammon said, "Look, me and my bros gonna head to Zarahemla; y'all chill here till we get back and peep if our fam's cool with y'all rolling in."
[Alma 27:16] As Ammon and his crew rolled into the land, they ran into Alma at the spot everyone talked about ... big vibes, happy reunion energy.
[Alma 27:17] Ammon's joy was next level, like totally maxed out...he was totally hit with God's vibes, so wild it drained him and he straight-up collapsed.
[Alma 27:18] Yo, isn't that some insane joy? Only real ones, truly sorry and humble, catch this kinda happiness.
[Alma 27:19] Alma's hype meeting his bros was mad real, same with Aaron, Omner, and Himni...but their joy kept it chill, no strength-draining flex like Ammon's.
[Alma 27:20] Alma led his crew back to Zarahemla, straight to his crib, and they spilled all the receipts to the chief judge about their wild times with the Lamanites in Nephi.
[Alma 27:21] The chief judge went viral with a shoutout across the land, asking the squad's vibe on letting the Anti-Nephi-Lehi fam slide into their crew.
[Alma 27:22] The people hit back, saying, "Bet, we'll hand over Jershon...east by the sea, next to Bountiful's south side...as inheritance for our new bros."
[Alma 27:23] We'll squad up between Jershon and Nephi to guard our bros in Jershon since they're too shook to fight back 'cause they don't wanna sin again...mad respect for their serious repentance after all those heavy past crimes.
[Alma 27:24] So, here's the deal: our bros get Jershon, we got their back with our armies...but only if they chip in some resources to keep our forces lit.
[Alma 27:25] Ammon heard the tea, bounced back to the Anti-Nephi-Lehi crew with Alma, out in the wilderness where they camped, and spilled all the deets...including Alma's glow-up story with Ammon, Aaron, and the squad.
[Alma 27:26] This news hit them with mad joy, so they rolled into Jershon, claimed the land, and from then on the Nephites dubbed them the people of Ammon...name stuck like glue.
[Alma 27:27] They vibed with the Nephites and repped the church squad hard, known for their hype zeal for God and people, keeping it 100% honest and loyal, holding tight to Christ's faith till the final buzzer.
[Alma 27:28] They low-key recoiled at the thought of shedding brother's blood, straight up refused to fight their own, and death? Nah, no cap, they weren't scared thanks to their hype hope in Christ and the resurrection...Christ basically yeeted death for them.
[Alma 27:29] They'd rather catch the worst death their own bros could throw at them than ever pick up a sword or sickle to strike back...no cap, that's mad respect for peace.
[Alma 27:30] So yeah, they were majorly hyped and loved, basically the Lord's top-tier, VIP squad.
[Alma 28:1] After the Ammon squad settled in Jershon and their church was up, with Nephite armies posted all around Jershon and Zarahemla's borders, the Lamanite armies low-key chased their own bros into the wilderness.
[Alma 28:2] So there was this epic battle, like nothing since Lehi dipped from Jerusalem...tens of thousands of Lamanites got totally wrecked and scattered everywhere, no cap.
[Alma 28:3] The Nephites took a savage L too, but still managed to push the Lamanites, who got scattered, letting the Nephites bounce back to their turf.
[Alma 28:4] This was peak sad vibes, tears everywhere across all Nephi's peeps...major mourning mode activated.
[Alma 28:5] Widows bawling for their hubs, dads feeling the loss of sons, sisters missing bros, bros missing dads...everyone crying out loud for their fallen fam, pure heartbreak all around.
[Alma 28:6] No cap, this day was straight-up heavy with sadness...everyone in deep feels, fasting hard, and sending prayers nonstop.
[Alma 28:7] And that's a wrap on year 15 of the judges running the Nephi scene, say less.
[Alma 28:8] Here's the tea on Ammon and crew: their travels in Nephi, the struggle, the pain, but also wild joy, plus how their peeps found safe haven in Jershon...may the Lord, the Redeemer, bless their souls forever, no cap.
[Alma 28:9] Here's the rundown on the fights and beefs within the Nephites, plus the wars vs. the Lamanites; year 15 of the judges' reign just closed out, bet.
[Alma 28:10] From year 1 to 15, straight-up chaos took thousands of lives...blood everywhere, a total horror show, no cap.
[Alma 28:11] Thousands are six feet under, heaps of bodies rotting above ground, and countless folks drowning in grief, scared their loved ones ended up in eternal misery like the Lord warned...straight-up tragic vibes.
[Alma 28:12] While many are still grieving, a whole lot are low-key hyped knowing, per the Lord's promises, their fam's vibing forever at God's right hand in eternal happiness...big W energy.
[Alma 28:13] So yeah, sin and the devil's sus moves show just how messy humans can get, with his slick traps designed to catch our hearts...big brain evil energy.
[Alma 28:14] We peep the major hustle needed to work in God's vineyard; feels heavy with both sad vibes from death and hype from Christ's light bringing life...sorrow and joy mixed, no cap.
[Alma 29:1] Low-key wish I was an angel so I could blast God's trumpet, shake the earth, and hype up every squad to repent...say less, let's get it!
[Alma 29:2] Bet, I'd drop the thunder voice telling every single soul to repent and peep the redemption plan, so we can dodge more global sorrow...no cap.
[Alma 29:3] But fr, I'm just a man trippin' on my own wish; I should just vibe with what God's handed me, no cap.
[Alma 29:4] I shouldn't be bugging over God's solid rules, 'cause He gives peeps what they want...whether that's death or life. He lays down unchangeable decrees based on our vibes, whether for saving or wrecking us, no cap.
[Alma 29:5] Facts, good and evil have been out here since forever; if you can't tell the difference, you're blameless, but if you can, you get what you want...good or bad, life or death, joy or mad guilt...straight up based on your vibe.
[Alma 29:6] Knowing all this, why would I wanna flex beyond grinding the work God legit called me to? Say less, just stick to the mission.
[Alma 29:7] Why would I catch feelings about being an angel just to preach worldwide when I got my own lane to run?
[Alma 29:8] God's out here hooking up every nation with teachers who speak their own language and serve wisdom as needed; His moves are straight-up just and true, no sus.
[Alma 29:9] I'm all about what God told me to do...no flex on me, just His commands. That's my main W: maybe being God's tool to turn someone around, and that's my real joy, no cap.
[Alma 29:10] Whenever I see my homies genuinely sorry and heading back to God, my soul's hyped AF; then I remember how God came thru for me, heard my prayers, and flexed His mercy big time.
[Alma 29:11] For real, I remember my ancestors' captivity, knowing God busted them out of bondage and set up His church; the same Lord of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob came through strong.
[Alma 29:12] Low-key, I've always remembered my ancestors' captivity, and that same God who flexed on the Egyptians to free them pulled up and delivered them again from bondage.
[Alma 29:13] Facts, that same God set up His church with them and called me with holy vibes to preach His word here, blessing me with mad success, filling me with pure joy.
[Alma 29:14] I'm not just hyped about my own wins...my joy's way bigger seeing my bros succeed and make moves up to the land of Nephi.
[Alma 29:15] No cap, they've been grinding hard and repped mad fruit...trust, their reward's gonna be next-level.
[Alma 29:16] Low-key, thinking about my bros' wins takes my soul on a whole trip, almost like it's ghosting my body...that's how wild my joy gets.
[Alma 29:17] Bet, I pray God hooks up my bros to chill forever in His kingdom, and all those they helped too...no cap, may they praise Him nonstop. Hope it goes down just like I said. Amen.
[Alma 30:1] So check it, after the Ammonites settled in Jershon and the Lamanites got bounced, with their bodies put to rest by the locals...say less.
[Alma 30:2] Dead bodies weren't even counted 'cause there were mad numbers on both sides; after burying them, fasting, mourning, and praying...and it was year sixteen of the judges...peace started vibing nonstop across the land.
[Alma 30:3] For real, the people stayed on God's commandments, sticking tight to His ordinances and Moses' law...'cause they were schooled to hold down that law till it's fully done.
[Alma 30:4] Straight up, the people had zero drama the whole sixteenth year of the judges ruling over Nephi.
[Alma 30:5] When year seventeen kicked off under the judges, peace kept flexing nonstop.
[Alma 30:6] But yo, late in year seventeen, this dude rolls into Zarahemla...total Anti-Christ energy...preaching against the prophets' receipts about Christ's coming.
[Alma 30:7] No cap, no law was out here forcing what folks had to believe...God said straight-up no to rules that level people unfairly.
[Alma 30:8] Scriptures drop this truth: Pick your squad to serve today, no cap.
[Alma 30:9] If someone wanted to serve God, big W for them; believing meant serving was their right, but if not, no law was gonna come for them.
[Alma 30:10] But if someone killed, they caught that death penalty; robbed, stole, or cheated...they all got punished hard for the wicked moves.
[Alma 30:11] The law said you get judged by your crimes, no cap; but beliefs? Nah, no law against that...so punishment hit only the moves you made, keeping everyone on level ground.
[Alma 30:12] This Anti-Christ dude Korihor...law couldn't touch him...started preaching that Christ was a no-show, spreading that message like a savage.
[Alma 30:13] Yo, all y'all stuck on some weak and dumb hope, why y'all vibing with that nonsense? Why chase Christ? No one can flex knowing the future, no cap.
[Alma 30:14] Peep this: those so-called prophecies y'all hype as holy drops from prophets? Nah, just dumb old traditions your dads cooked up.
[Alma 30:15] How you got receipts that's true? Facts are, you can't know stuff you ain't seen, so you can't say for sure there's gonna be a Christ.
[Alma 30:16] Y'all looking ahead, flexing like you see your sins wiped clean, but nah, that's just a mind trippin' hard; all that craziness is cause your dads' old traditions got you believing in straight-up fake news.
[Alma 30:17] He kept saying no way to atone for sins; everybody just vibes through life based on their own hustle...winning by their smarts, flexing by their strength...and whatever you do? Not even a crime, no cap.
[Alma 30:18] So he was out here preaching, pulling hearts to the dark side, making folks flex in their sin, dragging both women and men into wild stuff, hyping that once you die, that's game over, no sequel.
[Alma 30:19] This dude rolled up to Jershon too, spreading his anti-Christ vibes among the Ammonites, who used to be Lamanites, no cap.
[Alma 30:20] But these folks were smarter than most Nephites; they cuffed him up and dragged him to Ammon, their high priest flexing serious authority.
[Alma 30:21] They kicked him outta their land, so he bounced to Gideon and tried preaching there too...but no cap, he flopped again, got bound and dragged before the high priest and top judge like a total L.
[Alma 30:22] Then the high priest hit him with, "Why you out here twisting God's ways? Why you telling folks there's no Christ, killing their good vibes? Why you throwing shade on all the holy prophets' prophecies?"
[Alma 30:23] The high priest? Giddonah. Korihor clapped back, "I ain't about those dumb old traditions your dads pushed, or teaching folks to shack up under outdated rituals cooked up by priests flexing power to keep y'all clueless and bowed down, just like you said."
[Alma 30:24] You claim these people are free? Nah, they low-key in chains. You swear those old prophecies are real? Bet, but actually, you don't even know if that's true.
[Alma 30:25] You say these folks are guilty and messed up 'cause their parents slipped up? Nah fam, a kid ain't catching blame for what their parents did.
[Alma 30:26] And you say Christ's gonna roll up? Bet, but I'm calling sus...you don't even know if there's gonna be a Christ. Also, you say He'll get taken out for the world's sins...
[Alma 30:27] So you're out here dragging folks into your old-school, sus traditions and your own selfish vibes, keeping them lowkey trapped like slaves so you can feast on their grind...making sure they don't even have the nerve to stand tall or claim their own rights.
[Alma 30:28] Yeah, they're too scared to use their own stuff 'cause they don't wanna upset their priests, who boss them around based on their own wants and have them fooled with traditions, dreams, visions, and fake mysteries...making them think if they don't follow, they'll offend some ghostly God nobody's ever seen or will see.
[Alma 30:29] When the high priest and chief judge peeped his stubbornness and how he was straight-up roasting God, they clapped back with silence, had him cuffed, and handed him off to the officers to be shipped to Zarahemla for a showdown with Alma and the top judge running the whole land.
[Alma 30:30] When they dragged him before Alma and the chief judge, he kept up the same energy from Gideon...straight-up blaspheming like it was his brand.
[Alma 30:31] He came at Alma with mad hype, trash-talking the priests and teachers, calling them out for dragging folks into their dumb dad traditions just to pig out on everyone's hard work.
[Alma 30:32] Alma clapped back, "Bro, you know we don't pig out on the people's grind; I've been hustling with my own hands since day one of the judges' reign, even while I've been traveling all over dropping God's word to the squad."
[Alma 30:33] Even with all the church grind I've done, I've never pocketed a single senine; same for my crew, except when we're on the judgment-seat...and then it's just straight-up legal pay for our time, no extra flex.
[Alma 30:34] So if we ain't getting paid for church hustle, what's the point? It's just to spread the truth and vibe off the joy of our people, no cap.
[Alma 30:35] So why you say we preach for cash when you straight up know we don't get paid? Do you really think we'd scam people who are out here living their best joy?
[Alma 30:36] And Korihor just straight-up said, "Yea."
[Alma 30:37] Then Alma hit him with, "Do you even believe there's a God, or nah?"
[Alma 30:38] He shot back with a flat "Nay."
[Alma 30:39] Alma said, "So you're gonna keep denying God and Christ? 'Cause I'm telling you straight, I KNOW God exists and Christ's coming, no cap."
[Alma 30:40] Alma threw down, "What receipts you got that God ain't real or Christ won't show up? Spoiler: You got zero, just your own sus words."
[Alma 30:41] "Look, I got all the tea proving this truth, and you got the receipts too...so you really gonna ghost on them? Do you even believe this for real?"
[Alma 30:42] "I see you low-key believe, but you're caught up with a lying spirit, ghosting God's vibe so there's no room for it; the devil's got you on leash, dragging you around scheming to wreck God's kids."
[Alma 30:43] Korihor threw down, "Show me some signs that God's real and flexing power, and maybe then I'll vibe with your truth, no cap."
[Alma 30:44] Alma clapped back, "Bro, you've had enough signs already. You tryna test God? You got your squad's testimony, prophets' receipts, the scriptures all in your face, plus the earth spinning and planets vibing in order...straight-up proof there's a Supreme Creator."
[Alma 30:45] Still, you're out here twisting people's minds, telling them God ain't real? You really gonna ignore all these solid witnesses? He said, "Yeah, I'll keep denying unless you drop a sign."
[Alma 30:46] Alma said, "Honestly, it's lowkey sad how thick-headed you are, still flexing resistance to the Spirit of truth, risking your soul's total wipeout."
[Alma 30:47] "Honestly, it's better you lose your soul than wreck a bunch of others with your lies and sweet talk; so if you keep denying, God's gonna shut you up for good...no more lies, no more talk."
[Alma 30:48] Korihor was like, "I'm not straight-up denying God exists, just don't buy that He's real, and honestly I think you don't know either; unless you hit me with a sign, I'm staying skeptical."
[Alma 30:49] Alma clapped back, "Bet, here's your sign...you're gonna be struck dumb, no cap, in God's name you won't spit another word."
[Alma 30:50] Right after Alma said that, Korihor went mute, totally silenced like Alma predicted...no words came out, no cap.
[Alma 30:51] The chief judge saw this and slid Korihor a message: "So, you finally see God's power? Who did you want Alma to flex this sign on? You want him to mess with others just to prove a point? Bro, you got your sign...what else you wanna argue about?"
[Alma 30:52] Korihor wrote back, "I get it, I'm mute now and can't talk; only God's power could do this, and honestly, I always lowkey knew God was real."
[Alma 30:53] But real talk, the devil played me...showed up as an angel and told me to call out the crowd chasing some fake God; he said straight up, "There is no God," coached me on what to say, and I spread his lies 'cause they sounded fire to my fleshly mind, got big clout from it, believed it was legit, so I flexed against the truth until I snatched this massive curse on myself.
[Alma 30:54] After dropping that, he begged Alma to hit up God with some prayers so the curse could be lifted off him.
[Alma 30:55] Alma was like, "If I lift this curse, you'd just go back to messing with everyone's heads, so it's gonna be whatever the Lord decides."
[Alma 30:56] So yeah, the curse stuck, Korihor got ghosted and had to bounce from place to place, straight-up begging for food.
[Alma 30:57] News about Korihor's downfall blew up everywhere; the chief judge sent a major PSA telling all Korihor's believers to bounce back to repentance ASAP or they'd catch the same L's.
[Alma 30:58] Everyone caught the vibe that Korihor was straight-up wicked, so they all bounced back to the Lord, killing that Korihor-style sin; meanwhile, Korihor kept hustling from door to door, begging for his next meal.
[Alma 30:59] So Korihor rolls up to these folks who split from the Nephites...calling themselves Zoramites, led by Zoram...and bam, they straight-up run him over and stomp him out till he's dead.
[Alma 30:60] This is the finale for anyone twisting God's ways; turns out the devil ghosts his own squad when the end comes and drags them down to hell real quick.
[Alma 31:1] After Korihor's fall, Alma caught the tea that the Zoramites were twisting God's ways and their leader Zoram had everyone bowing to lame idols, and fam, Alma's heart seriously started to hurt over their mess.
[Alma 31:2] It hit Alma hard knowing his people were deep in sin, and he was mad sad about the Zoramites splitting from the Nephites like that.
[Alma 31:3] The Zoramites squad'd up in Antionum, east of Zarahemla near the coast, south of Jershon, right by the wild side full of Lamanites.
[Alma 31:4] The Nephites were low-key shook that the Zoramites might link up with the Lamanites, which could straight-up wreck the Nephites big time.
[Alma 31:5] Since preaching the word had way more clout making people do right than swords or battles, Alma figured they had to flex God's word and see how it plays out.
[Alma 31:6] So Alma grabbed Ammon, Aaron, and Omner ... left Himni holding down the church in Zarahemla ... and rolled out with those three plus Amulek and Zeezrom from Melek, plus two of his own sons.
[Alma 31:7] Alma left his oldest, Helaman, behind but took Shiblon and Corianton along to hit up the Zoramites and drop some truth bombs.
[Alma 31:8] The Zoramites had dipped from the Nephites, but they still got the word of God preached to their crew.
[Alma 31:9] But they went full sus, ignoring God's commandments and Moses' rules, straight up off the rails.
[Alma 31:10] They weren't about that church life...skipping daily prayers and begging God to keep them from catching temptation vibes.
[Alma 31:11] Straight up, they twisted God's ways on multiple levels, so Alma and his crew rolled into their turf to preach and set things right.
[Alma 31:12] Pulling up, Alma and the squad were low-key shook to see the Zoramites had built synagogues and were squad-deep every week on the "day of the Lord," worshipping in a way they'd never even seen before.
[Alma 31:13] They had this vibe-check spot in the middle of their synagogue, raised way above head height, and only one person could flex up there at a time.
[Alma 31:14] So, anyone wanting to worship had to step up on that throne, throw their hands to the sky, and shout out loud like their main character moment depended on it.
[Alma 31:15] They'd yell, "Holy, holy God; we vibe with you as God, knowing you've always been spirit and will stay spirit forever, no cap."
[Alma 31:16] They'd flex, "Holy God, we're the chosen ones, not buying our fam's old-school traditions...said you split us from our bros and straight up told us there's no Christ, no cap."
[Alma 31:17] They'd say, "You're the same boss yesterday, today, forever, choosing us for salvation while everyone else faces wrath and hell; big thanks for that holiness and for keeping us off our brothers' dumb Christ hype that clout-chases away from you, God."
[Alma 31:18] And again, big ups, God, for making us the chosen holy squad. Amen, say less.
[Alma 31:19] So, Alma and his crew and sons heard those prayers and legit got shook beyond any vibe check.
[Alma 31:20] For real, every single dude stepped up and dropped the exact same prayer bars.
[Alma 31:21] They called that spot Rameumptom, which low-key means the "holy stand"...main stage energy for worship.
[Alma 31:22] From that holy stand, every dude said the same prayer, flexing gratitude for being chosen and not getting led astray by their bros' traditions or caught up in believing unknown future stuff.
[Alma 31:23] After everyone dropped their thank-you prayers, they bounced home and went radio silent on God until the next holy stand meetup to rinse and repeat the same routine.
[Alma 31:24] When Alma peeped this, his heart straight-up hurt; he saw these folks were sus and twisted, all about that gold, silver, and flexing with fancy stuff.
[Alma 31:25] For real, he also clocked their hearts were full of big flex and mad pride, straight-up boasting nonstop.
[Alma 31:26] Alma raised his voice to the sky, yelling, "Yo Lord, how long you gonna let your crew live down here stuck in flesh, watching this wild wickedness from humans?"
[Alma 31:27] Look, God, they're out here crying to you, but their hearts are low-key lost in pride; they mouth off prayers while flexing mad hard on empty worldly stuff.
[Alma 31:28] Yo God, check their pricey drip...rings, bracelets, gold bling, and all that shine...but their hearts are stuck on that flex, yet they still hit you with, "Thanks, God, we're your chosen squad while others get played out."
[Alma 31:29] For real, they say you straight-up told them there's no Christ coming.
[Alma 31:30] Yo Lord God, how long you gonna let this nasty wickedness and disbelief run wild here? Give me strength to deal with my weak spots 'cause this mess's got my soul hurting bad.
[Alma 31:31] Lord, my heart's hella heavy; hook my soul up with comfort through Christ. Please grant me strength to patiently handle the struggles coming my way 'cause of these people's messed-up ways.
[Alma 31:32] Lord, bless my soul with comfort and success, and do the same for my crew...Ammon, Aaron, Omner, Amulek, Zeezrom, and even my two sons...yeah, hook all their souls up with that Christ comfort.
[Alma 31:33] Please grant them the strength to tough out the struggles coming their way because of this crowd's messed-up sins.
[Alma 31:34] Yo Lord, bless us so we can pull off the win and bring these peeps back to you through Christ, say less.
[Alma 31:35] Look, Lord, their souls are straight-up precious and a bunch are our own fam; so bless us with power and wisdom to reel these brethren back to you.
[Alma 31:36] After Alma dropped those prayers, he clapped on everyone around him, and boom...they got hit with the Holy Spirit vibes, no cap.
[Alma 31:37] Then they split up, low-key forgetting about food, drinks, or what to wear...mad focused, no distractions.
[Alma 31:38] The Lord came through...no hunger, no thirst, plus mad strength so any pain got buried under Christ's joy; all thanks to Alma's faith-powered prayers, no cap.
[Alma 32:1] So they bounced out and started dropping God's word everywhere ... synagogues, homes, even straight-up in the streets, no chill.
[Alma 32:2] After grinding hard, they started winning over the poor folks...people who got straight-up kicked from synagogues 'cause their clothes were too ratchet.
[Alma 32:3] So these peeps got banned from synagogues, seen as straight-up trash; not just broke IRL, but their hearts felt lowkey empty too, all cause their own fam looked down on them.
[Alma 32:4] While Alma was preaching on the hill Onidah, a big crowd showed up...those same folks lowkey broke in both cash and spirit, like we said before.
[Alma 32:5] They rolled up to Alma, and their leader was like, "So, what's the move for my crew? Everyone, especially our priests, lowkey hate on us 'cause we're broke. We busted our asses building synagogues with our own hands, and they still booted us out. Now, no spot to worship God...what now?"
[Alma 32:6] When Alma caught that, he flipped to face the dude with big joy...seeing their struggles had low-key humbled them and they were ready to soak up the word, big vibes.
[Alma 32:7] So Alma shut up the crowd, threw up his hand, and called out the real repentant ones like, "Listen up."
[Alma 32:8] I see y'all got that humble heart energy; if that's true, consider yourselves blessed, no cap.
[Alma 32:9] Your brother straight up asked, "What's the move? We got kicked outta our synagogues and can't worship God anymore."
[Alma 32:10] Look, I gotta ask...y'all really think the only way to worship God is just inside your synagogues? Bet.
[Alma 32:11] Also, do you seriously think worshipping God is a once-a-week flex only? Nah, that's sus.
[Alma 32:12] I'm telling you, getting kicked outta your synagogues is actually a W...it humbles you and teaches you wisdom, 'cause being dissed by your own folks for being mad poor drags you down to real humility.
[Alma 32:13] Since y'all forced into humility, big bless...sometimes being humbled makes a dude wanna repent; for real, anyone who repents scores mercy, and those who hold that down till the end? They're saved, no cap.
[Alma 32:14] Like I said, being forced humble is a bless, but don't you think those who genuinely humble themselves 'cause of the word are even more blessed? Say less.
[Alma 32:15] For real, the one who truly humbles, repents, and sticks it out till the end gets way more blessed than those just forced humble 'cause of mad poverty.
[Alma 32:16] So for real, biggest bless goes to those who humble themselves on their own...like, anyone who believes God's word and gets baptized without being salty or forced to know the truth first is winning big.
[Alma 32:17] Yeah, plenty be like, "Show us a heavenly sign first, then we'll vibe and believe for sure."
[Alma 32:18] So lemme ask... is that even faith? Nah fam, 'cause if you already know something, believing ain't a thing; you just know it, no cap.
[Alma 32:19] Real talk, who's more cursed? The one who straight-up knows God's will and ghosts it, or the one who just believes (or could believe) but still slips up? Definitely the first is way more sus.
[Alma 32:20] You gotta judge this for yourself: honestly, it's balanced both ways, and everyone's gonna get dealt based on their own grind.
[Alma 32:21] Like I said, faith ain't about having perfect receipts; it's about hoping for stuff you can't see yet but know's legit, no cap.
[Alma 32:22] Yo, remember this: God's mad merciful to everyone who trusts His name, and straight up He wants first and foremost for you to believe...like, even just on His word alone.
[Alma 32:23] God drops His word through angels to men and women alike, and get this...kids get hit with wisdom too that straight-up leaves even the smartest folks shook.
[Alma 32:24] Alright fam, since you asked what to do being lowkey struggling and outcast, don't think I'm just here to judge you by the strict facts only...say less.
[Alma 32:25] I'm saying, not everyone was forced to humble up; low-key, I believe some of you would humble yourselves no matter what drama you're caught in.
[Alma 32:26] Like I said about faith not being perfect knowledge, my words are the same ... you won't get full-on receipts on them right away, just like faith ain't perfect knowledge at first.
[Alma 32:27] But yo, if you wake up and start testing my words, flex even a bit of faith...like just wanting to believe...let that vibe build till you actually believe enough to accept some of what I'm saying.
[Alma 32:28] So check it: think of the word like a seed planted in your heart. If it's legit and you don't ghost it with doubt or block the Spirit, it'll start growing inside you. When you feel that growth, you'll low-key realize this seed (the word) is straight fire ... expanding your soul, lighting up your mind, and tasting mad good to you.
[Alma 32:29] So, wouldn't that boost your faith? Bet it would, but nah, it still hasn't leveled up to perfect knowledge yet.
[Alma 32:30] As that seed swells and sprouts and starts to grow, you gotta admit it's legit; seeing it pop off like that will low-key pump up your faith 'cause you'll say, "No cap, this seed's real, it's growing."
[Alma 32:31] So, you sure this seed's legit? Bet you are, 'cause every seed flexes exactly what it's built to be.
[Alma 32:32] Straight up, if that seed grows it's a W, but if it's deadweight and won't grow, then it's sus and gets tossed.
[Alma 32:33] Since you ran the test, planted the seed, and it's swelling, sprouting, and popping off, you gotta know this seed's a legit L/W ... straight good.
[Alma 32:34] So, is your knowledge perfect now? Bet it is...your faith's just chillin' low-key 'cause you know the word's pumped up your soul, sprouted, and your understanding and mind are leveling up.
[Alma 32:35] So, is this for real? Bet it is, 'cause light equals clarity and good vibes ... it's obvious and clear, so you gotta know it's legit. After catching that glow, is your knowledge perfect now?
[Alma 32:36] Nah, I'm saying don't ditch your faith yet; you only flexed it to plant the seed and test if it was legit.
[Alma 32:37] As the tree starts growing, you're like, "Let's feed it good so it roots deep, grows tall, and drops some fruit." For real, if you nurture it right, it'll root up, glow up, and bring that fruit.
[Alma 32:38] But if you ghost the tree and don't care for it, it won't root, and when the heat hits, it'll dry up and die ... then you just yank it out and toss it.
[Alma 32:39] It ain't that the seed's trash or the fruit unwanted; it's 'cause your soil's dead and you won't bother feeding the tree, so no fruit for you.
[Alma 32:40] So if you don't feed the word and keep faith-focused on the fruit, you'll never snag any fruit from the tree of life...say less.
[Alma 32:41] But if you grind on nourishing the word and the tree with solid faith, patience, and focus on the fruit, it'll root deep and blow up into a tree flexing everlasting life.
[Alma 32:42] 'Cause you put in the work, faith, and patience to feed the word and let it root in you, soon you'll grab the fruit...mad precious, sweeter than anything, purest of the pure...and you'll feast till you're full, no hunger or thirst vibes.
[Alma 32:43] So, fam, you'll flex the perks of your faith, grind, patience, and mad stamina, all for waiting on the tree to drop that fruit for you.
[Alma 33:1] After Alma dropped those bars, they hit him up asking if they should trust in one God to score the fruit he talked about, how to plant that seed...the word he said gotta go in their hearts...and how to start flexing their faith.
[Alma 33:2] Alma clapped back, saying, "You said you can't worship God 'cause you got kicked from your synagogues, but nah, that's a big L. If you think you can't worship, you're dead wrong. Go read the scriptures; if you think they taught you that, you're totally missing the vibe."
[Alma 33:3] Yo, do you remember reading what Zenos, that OG prophet, said about prayer and worship?
[Alma 33:4] He said: "God, you're mad merciful, hearing my prayer even out in the wilderness; you showed mercy when I prayed for my haters and even turned them back to me."
[Alma 33:5] Yeah, God, you were straight-up merciful when I yelled to you in my field, prayed loud, and you actually heard me.
[Alma 33:6] And again, God, when I bounced back to my crib, you caught my prayer and heard me loud and clear.
[Alma 33:7] And when I dipped into my closet to pray, Lord, you were there, hearing every word.
[Alma 33:8] Facts: You're mad merciful to your kids when they call out to you, wanting your ear, not anyone else's...and you always hear them.
[Alma 33:9] For real, God, you've shown mercy and heard my cries even when I was surrounded by your crowds.
[Alma 33:10] Yeah, and you heard me when I got tossed aside and roasted by my haters; you caught my cries, got heated at them, and served them quick destruction, no cap.
[Alma 33:11] You heard me 'cause of my struggles and realness; all mercy comes through your Son, so I'll keep yelling to you through all my pain...my joy's in you since you flipped your judgments off me thanks to your Son.
[Alma 33:12] Now Alma hits them with, "Y'all actually believe those old-school scriptures they wrote back in the day?"
[Alma 33:13] Look, if you're vibing with that, you gotta believe what Zenos said...like, God flipped his judgments 'cause of his Son, no cap.
[Alma 33:14] Yo, fam, have you even peeped the scriptures? If you have, how you gonna doubt the Son of God? Say less.
[Alma 33:15] It ain't just Zenos dropping these truths; Zenock was on the same wave too...no cap.
[Alma 33:16] Peep this: He said, "God, you're mad salty at these folks since they just don't get the mercy you flexed on them 'cause of your Son."
[Alma 33:17] So, fam, you see a second OG prophet hyped the Son of God, but the crowd was so sus about his message, they straight-up stoned him to death.
[Alma 33:18] But hold up, that's just the start; plenty more have been spilling the tea on the Son of God too.
[Alma 33:19] Check it...Moses was already spilling facts about him; even a symbol got raised in the wilderness so anyone who peeped it could survive, and trust, many did and stayed alive.
[Alma 33:20] But real talk, not many caught the meaning 'cause their hearts were mad hard; some were so stubborn they didn't even look and just straight-up died...why? 'Cause they low-key didn't believe it could heal them.
[Alma 33:21] Yo, fam, if just looking around could heal you, wouldn't you peep it ASAP? Or nah, you gonna keep flexing that hard heart and lazy vibe, ignoring the chance and end up dead? Bruh, choose the W.
[Alma 33:22] If you keep playing that way, shame's on you; but if not, look around, start believing in the Son of God who's gonna redeem y'all, suffer, die for your sins, then bounce back from the dead to run the final judgment...everyone's gonna stand before him and get judged based on their moves.
[Alma 33:23] Alright fam, I want y'all to vibe with this word deep in your hearts...feed it with faith, let it grow into a whole tree of eternal life inside you. Then God might bless you with light burdens and mad joy through His Son. And all this? Totally doable if you're down. Amen.
[Alma 34:1] So after Alma dropped those facts, he chilled on the ground, and then Amulek stood up ready to school the crowd, saying:
[Alma 34:2] Yo fam, no cap, I can't believe y'all are clueless about the stuff we've been dropping on Christ's arrival...our Son of God. For real, you've been schooled on this big time before y'all bounced from our crew.
[Alma 34:3] Since y'all hit up my bro to spill what to do 'cause of your struggles, he dropped some wisdom to get your minds right and pushed y'all to hold tight with faith and patience...say less.
[Alma 34:4] Bet, he wants y'all to flex crazy faith...like, plant the word deep in your hearts and actually test out how fire it is.
[Alma 34:5] We see the big mood you're stuck on: is the word really in the Son of God or is Christ just a no-show?
[Alma 34:6] Plus, you saw my bro flex major receipts showing time and again that salvation's locked in the word through Christ.
[Alma 34:7] My bro hit up Zenos' bars, saying redemption's only through the Son of God, dropped Zenock's vibe too, and even brought Moses into the mix to back the whole thing up.
[Alma 34:8] Now listen up, I'm putting my own stamp on this...no cap, I know Christ's sliding into the human scene to cop the sins of His people and make atonement for the whole world; God Himself said it, facts.
[Alma 34:9] Real talk, atonement's a must...God's grand plan needs it or everyone's toast. Everyone's low-key hardened and fallen, doomed without that atonement coming through.
[Alma 34:10] So, the plan's gotta have one big, final sacrifice...not some dude, not a beast, not even a bird...no human sacrifices here. It's gotta be infinite and eternal, no cap.
[Alma 34:11] Look, no person can spill their own blood to cover someone else's sins. If a dude murders, our fair law doesn't say to kill his bro in return...straight up, no.
[Alma 34:12] The law demands the life of the killer, so anything less than an infinite atonement just won't cut it for covering the world's sins.
[Alma 34:13] So yeah, we need that final, epic sacrifice to put an end to bloodshed; only then does the law of Moses get fully checked off...every single detail, no cap.
[Alma 34:14] Peep this...the whole law's vibe points straight to that ultimate sacrifice, which is the Son of God himself, big boss infinite and eternal energy, no cap.
[Alma 34:15] So He's gonna deliver salvation to everyone who vibes with His name; that last sacrifice is all about mad mercy flexing harder than justice, giving folks the juice to have faith and turn their lives around.
[Alma 34:16] Mercy slides in to meet justice's demands, wrapping believers in a safety hug, but anyone ghosting faith and repentance gets hit with the full legal tea...so only the ones who actually repent get in on the eternal redemption plan.
[Alma 34:17] So fam, hope God blesses y'all to start flexing that faith with real repentance and to hit up His holy name for some mercy vibes.
[Alma 34:18] Deadass, shout out to Him for mercy...He's got the power to save, no cap.
[Alma 34:19] Low-key humble yourselves and keep sliding into prayer with Him nonstop.
[Alma 34:20] Hit Him up with prayers whether you're out in the fields or chillin' with all your flocks...say less.
[Alma 34:21] Blow up His line with prayers at home, over fam, morning, noon, and night...no breaks.
[Alma 34:22] For real, shout at Him to flex on your enemies' power when they get sus.
[Alma 34:23] Straight up, call on Him to clap back at the devil, the OG enemy of all things good.
[Alma 34:24] Pray up for your crops to thrive and glow up in your fields...God's got the plug for that growth.
[Alma 34:25] Hit Him with prayers for your flocks to multiply and secure the W in your fields.
[Alma 34:26] But wait, don't cap...spill your soul deep in your closets, secret spots, and even solo in the wilderness.
[Alma 34:27] And when you ain't straight-up crying out, keep your heart locked in prayer vibes for your own glow-up and everyone around you, nonstop.
[Alma 34:28] Yo fam, don't think this is the whole playbook; after all that prayer flex, if you ghost the needy, naked, sick, or don't share your bread with those in need...no cap, your prayers are straight-up fake and useless, making you look like faith-denying frauds.
[Alma 34:29] So if you forget to be charitable, you're basically useless trash...like dross the pros toss out and everyone just walks all over you.
[Alma 34:30] Alright squad, now that you've got mad receipts from the scriptures, it's time to level up and actually bring that repentance juice with real fruit.
[Alma 34:31] Bet, I want y'all to stop ghosting your hearts...now's the moment, the day of your salvation. So if you repent and don't stay sus, the big redemption move is coming at you ASAP.
[Alma 34:32] Look, this life's the grind time to get ready to face God; today's the day to put in the work, no cap.
[Alma 34:33] Like I said, with all these receipts, don't sleep on repenting till last minute; after this life prep grind, comes the dark night with zero chances to hustle for your soul.
[Alma 34:34] When you hit that scary final boss moment, you can't just say "I'll repent later" ... nah, the vibe controlling you then is the same one that'll own your soul forever.
[Alma 34:35] If you keep dodging repentance till you die, congrats...you're basically signed up with the devil's crew, God bounces on you, and Satan runs the show; that's the ultimate L for the wicked.
[Alma 34:36] Here's the tea: God doesn't vibe with unholy temples, He chills in righteous hearts; plus, the righteous get the ultimate staycation in His kingdom, rocking fresh white fits thanks to the Lamb's blood.
[Alma 34:37] Yo fam, I'm saying keep these facts on lock, grind on your salvation with some serious respect for God, and quit frontin' about Christ's comeback.
[Alma 34:38] Stop beefing with the Holy Ghost, start vibing with it, rep Christ's name, humble yourself hardcore, worship God wherever you at...real talk...and flex gratitude every day for all the blessings He's dropping on you.
[Alma 34:39] For real, stay woke with nonstop prayer so the devil's sus temptations don't catch you slipping and make you part of his squad on Judgment Day...he's all about bad vibes, no good rewards.
[Alma 34:40] Yo fam, flex patience and tough it out through all the shade and struggles; don't start throwing hate at those who ghost you for your broke status, or you'll be catching the same Ls as them.
[Alma 34:41] Keep that patience on lock, ride out the struggles with solid hope that one day you'll finally catch a break from all the pain.
[Alma 35:1] So after Amulek dropped his speech, they dipped from the crowd and bounced over to the land of Jershon.
[Alma 35:2] Yeah, and the squad who preached to the Zoramites pulled up too, joining the crew in Jershon.
[Alma 35:3] So, the Zoramite influencers huddled up after hearing the preach and got mad 'cause the message clapped their whole hustle, so they straight up ghosted the words.
[Alma 35:4] They went full-on group chat mode, pulling everyone from all over the land to squad up and spill tea on those preachy words.
[Alma 35:5] Their big shots...rulers, priests, and teachers...kept their own agendas on stealth mode, so they low-key scoped out what the people were really thinking.
[Alma 35:6] After spying on the people's thoughts, the ones vibing with Alma and crew's message got yeeted from the land...there were a bunch...and they bounced to Jershon too.
[Alma 35:7] Alma and his crew kept preaching and supporting them no cap.
[Alma 35:8] The Zoramites were salty at the Ammonites chilling in Jershon, and their big boss...straight-up evil...sent threats saying, "Kick out anyone who fled to you from our turf."
[Alma 35:9] He was spitting mad threats, but the Ammonites weren't shook...they kept the Zoramite poor on deck, fed, clothed, hooked them up with land, and helped out however they needed.
[Alma 35:10] This move got the Zoramites heated at the Ammonites, so they started linking with the Lamanites to hype up even more beef against them.
[Alma 35:11] So the Zoramites and Lamanites started gearing up for war, aiming at the Ammonites and the Nephites squad.
[Alma 35:12] And that's a wrap on year 17 of the judges running the show over the Nephi peeps.
[Alma 35:13] The Ammonites dipped from Jershon to Melek, freeing up Jershon for the Nephite armies to throw down against the Lamanites and Zoramites...war kicked off in year 18, and the receipts on their battles are coming soon.
[Alma 35:14] Alma, Ammon, their bros, plus Alma's two sons rolled back to Zarahemla after God used them big time to turn a bunch of Zoramites around; even though most got kicked out, they scored land in Jershon and are ready to flex with arms to protect their fam and turf.
[Alma 35:15] Alma was lowkey crushed over his people's mess...wars, bloodshed, mad beef...and after preaching everywhere, he saw folks' hearts went stone-cold and they got salty about the word's tough vibes, leaving his soul seriously wrecked.
[Alma 35:16] So Alma pulled his sons together to drop personalized wisdom on living right, and we got the receipts of his commandments straight from his own notes.
[Alma 36:1] Yo son, listen up...no cap, if you keep God's commandments, you're gonna thrive in this land, say less.
[Alma 36:2] I want you to vibe with what I did...remember our ancestors' captivity, stuck in chains with no plug but the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who for real saved them from all their struggles.
[Alma 36:3] Yo son Helaman, you're young, so fr, hear me out and learn...if you trust God, He's got your back through all the struggles and will boost you up on Judgment Day, no cap.
[Alma 36:4] And don't get it twisted...I'm not flexing on my own smarts, not about the surface stuff but the spiritual realness, straight from God, not just my carnal brain.
[Alma 36:5] Look, if God hadn't had my back from birth, I'd be clueless on this; God dropped these truths through his holy angel, not cuz I earned any clout myself.
[Alma 36:6] I used to roll with Mosiah's crew trying to cancel God's church, but God sent his holy angel to block us mid-move, no cap.
[Alma 36:7] Then the angel spoke like thunder booming, earth shook under us, and we all faceplanted...straight terror flex when the fear of the Lord hit us hard.
[Alma 36:8] Then the voice said, "Get up." So I bounced up, stood tall, and peeped the angel right there.
[Alma 36:9] He told me straight: if you wanna wreck yourself, stop trying to cancel God's church, no cap.
[Alma 36:10] So I crashed to the ground and for three full days and nights, I was straight mute and paralyzed...couldn't move or speak, no lie.
[Alma 36:11] The angel kept talking, my bros heard it but I was shook...when I caught "If you wanna be destroyed, stop attacking God's church," fear hit me like a truck, and I dropped to the ground, zoning out the rest.
[Alma 36:12] I was legit tormented forever, my soul got wrecked hardcore, weighed down by every sin I'd stacked.
[Alma 36:13] Deadass, I remembered every sin and screw-up, felt hell's pain heavy on me; saw I'd straight rebelled on God and ghosted His holy rules.
[Alma 36:14] Bet, I'd taken out a bunch of His kids...or well, low-key led them straight to doom; my sins were so massive just thinking about facing God crushed my soul with horror words can't even flex.
[Alma 36:15] Man, I wished I could just ghost...vanish body and soul...to dodge standing before God and catching that judgment for my actions.
[Alma 36:16] For three straight days and nights, I was tormented, feeling all the agony of a soul straight doomed.
[Alma 36:17] While I was getting wrecked by torment and haunted by my sins' receipts, I suddenly remembered my dad hyped the prophecy about Jesus Christ, God's Son, coming to fix the world's sin mess.
[Alma 36:18] As that vibe hit me, I straight up begged in my heart: Yo Jesus, Son of God, cut me some slack...I'm drowning in bitterness and trapped in death's endless chains.
[Alma 36:19] Then, real talk, once I had that thought, my pain ghosted, and the weight of my sins stopped haunting me.
[Alma 36:20] Bro, the joy and insane light I caught hit harder than my pain ever did...my soul was flexing pure happiness on a whole new level.
[Alma 36:21] For real, my son, nothing was as savage and bitter as my pain...but low-key, nothing flexed sweeter and more fire than my joy after.
[Alma 36:22] Yo, I legit felt like I saw God chilling on His throne, squad deep with endless angels straight vibing and praising, and my soul was mad thirsty to pull up there too.
[Alma 36:23] Then, no cap, my body got its drip back, I stood up strong, and flexed to everyone that I was straight born of God.
[Alma 36:24] Since then, I've been grinding nonstop to pull souls into repentance, so they can vibe with the insane joy I caught, get born of God, and be packed with the Holy Ghost.
[Alma 36:25] Yo, my son, real talk...the Lord's blessing me with mad joy from the results of all my hustle.
[Alma 36:26] Straight up, 'cause of what God dropped on me, tons have been born of Him, tasted the same fire, peeped the same vision, so they get the tea like I do...and my knowledge? Pure God vibes.
[Alma 36:27] I've been through mad trials and all kinds of mess, got rescued from prison, chains, and even death...no cap, I trust God, and He's still got my back.
[Alma 36:28] Bet, I know He'll raise me up on the last day to chill with Him in glory, and I'll hype Him forever...He pulled our fathers outta Egypt, dunked on the Egyptians in the Red Sea, led His crew by His power to the promised land, and kept freeing them from chains again and again.
[Alma 36:29] For real, He also hauled our fathers outta Jerusalem, and by His endless power kept busting them outta bondage over and over...even up 'til now...and I never forgot their struggle; you should keep that memory alive too, no cap.
[Alma 36:30] Yo, my son, listen up...if you're out here keeping God's commandments, you'll be winning big in the land; but if you ghost those rules, you're getting straight cut off from His presence. That's His word, no cap.
[Alma 37:1] Yo, my son Helaman, I'm telling you straight...grab the records that were handed down to me.
[Alma 37:2] Also, I'm putting you on: keep a record of our people just like I did, on the plates of Nephi, and guard all this info sacredly...no cap, it's kept for a smart-ass reason.
[Alma 37:3] These plates of brass got the holy scriptures engraved, plus the family tree of our ancestors straight from day one...no cap.
[Alma 37:4] Peep this: our forefathers prophesied these plates gotta be passed down every gen and kept safe by God's hand until they drop worldwide...every nation, squad, language, and people gotta get the teas on the mysteries inside.
[Alma 37:5] So check it, if these plates are kept safe, they'll keep shining bright, no cap...and same goes for all plates holding the holy scriptures.
[Alma 37:6] You might think I'm wild for this, but low-key, big moves come from small, simple stuff...and sometimes those tiny things totally roast the so-called wise.
[Alma 37:7] God's out here using low-key subtle moves to pull off His epic eternal plans, flexing on the wise while saving mad souls.
[Alma 37:8] So far, God's OG wisdom said to keep these things safe, 'cause they boosted our people's memory, woke many up from their bad moves, and plugged them into knowing God for soul-saving vibes.
[Alma 37:9] Deadass, without the stuff locked in these plates, Ammon and his crew couldn't have convinced thousands of Lamanites to drop their old sus traditions; these records and their words hit different, bringing mad repentance and hyping them up on knowing God and flexing joy in Jesus Christ the Redeemer.
[Alma 37:10] Who knows, maybe these records will be the plug that pulls thousands of them...and even our stubborn Nephite bros, caught up in sin and flexing hard hearts...into knowing their Redeemer, no cap.
[Alma 37:11] Low-key, these mysteries ain't fully unpacked for me yet, so I'm gonna chill and hold back for now.
[Alma 37:12] I'm just gonna say they're kept safe for a smart-ass reason only God knows, 'cause He's the OG boss of wisdom, always running His game straight and on that eternal loop.
[Alma 37:13] Yo, son Helaman, don't forget how tight God's commandments are...He said follow 'em and you'll flex success in the land; ignore 'em and you get ghosted from His presence, no cap.
[Alma 37:14] Heads up, son, God put you in charge of these sacred things He's kept on lock, and He'll keep 'em safe for a smart reason...to flex His power on future generations.
[Alma 37:15] Real talk by prophecy vibes: if you break God's commandments, those sacred things get snatched from you by His power, and you'll get handed over to Satan to get tossed like chaff in the wind.
[Alma 37:16] But if you keep God's commandments and handle these sacred things like He says...always checking in with Him...then no force on earth or hell can snatch them from you, 'cause God's power always makes His word real.
[Alma 37:17] God always pulls through on His promises to you, just like He's been solid on the promises to our ancestors...no cap.
[Alma 37:18] He promised to keep these things safe for a smart reason in His plan, so He can flex His power to future generations.
[Alma 37:19] Look, He already nailed one goal: bringing thousands of Lamanites back to the truth, showing His power through them, and He'll keep flexing that power for generations...so they'll stay protected.
[Alma 37:20] So listen up, son Helaman, grind hard to keep all my words and stay on your A-game following God's commandments exactly as written, no slacking.
[Alma 37:21] Now peep this about the twenty-four plates: keep 'em safe so the shady secrets and dark deeds...murders, thefts, all their nasty moves...get exposed to the people; and for real, protect those interpreters too.
[Alma 37:22] God saw His people lowkey grinding in the dark, pulling secret murders and mad abominations; so He warned if they didn't repent, they'd get wiped off the map, no cap.
[Alma 37:23] So God said He'll hook up His servant Gazelem with a stone that lights up in the dark, to reveal to His loyal peeps the shady deeds...their secret dark moves and all the nasty stuff their bros been up to.
[Alma 37:24] Yo son, these interpreters were set up so God's word could drop exactly like He said it would.
[Alma 37:25] I'm gonna expose all their secret dark deeds and abominations; if they don't repent, I'll wipe them off the earth, and I'll spill all their secrets to every nation that later owns the land.
[Alma 37:26] So son, they didn't repent, got destroyed, and God's word came through; their nasty secrets got exposed from the shadows and we know the receipts now.
[Alma 37:27] Alright son, keep all their oaths, covenants, and secret dirty deals on lock, plus their signs and wonders...don't let the people catch the vibe, or they might catch the darkness and get wiped too.
[Alma 37:28] Look, this land's cursed...everyone grinding in darkness gonna catch destruction when the time's right, all by God's power; so I'm low-key hoping these people dodge that fate.
[Alma 37:29] So keep their secret oaths and covenants on the DL from the people; only spill their wickedness, murders, and abominations, and teach everyone to straight-up hate that stuff...and remind 'em that's why those folks got wrecked.
[Alma 37:30] They straight-up clapped all the Lord's prophets who tried to call out their sins; the murdered prophets' blood screamed to God for justice, so God's wrath hit those dark workers and secret crews hard.
[Alma 37:31] Yeah, the land's cursed forever against those dark workers and secret squads, doomed to destruction...unless they bounce and repent before they're fully cooked.
[Alma 37:32] Yo son, lock in what I said...don't spill those secret plans to the people; instead, school them to hate sin and wickedness forever, no cap.
[Alma 37:33] Tell them to repent and put mad faith in Jesus Christ; teach 'em to stay humble, chill, and low-key in heart, and flex their faith to block every devilish move.
[Alma 37:34] Teach them to never get tired of doing good, stay humble and chill in heart; that's how they'll find soul-level rest, no cap.
[Alma 37:35] Yo, son, remember this and get wise while you're young; frfr, start keeping God's commandments early on.
[Alma 37:36] For real, pray to God for backup in everything; make all your moves about the Lord, wherever you go vibe with Him, keep your thoughts locked on Him, and put your heart's rizz on the Lord forever.
[Alma 37:37] Always check with the Lord on your moves, He'll steer you right; when you crash at night, hand it over to Him to watch your back, and wake up with mad gratitude...do this and you'll flex big time on the last day.
[Alma 37:38] Yo son, gotta spill on that thing our dads called a ball or director...straight up known as the Liahona, aka a compass, crafted by the Lord Himself.
[Alma 37:39] No cap, no human could flex that kind of intricate design; it was made to guide our ancestors on their path through the wilderness, say less.
[Alma 37:40] That gadget worked based on their faith in God; if they believed God could make those spindles point right, boom...it happened. They flexed this miracle and loads more daily, powered by God's own horsepower.
[Alma 37:41] Low-key, those miracles came through small stuff but showed epic moves; when they got lazy and quit flexing faith and grind, the miracles ghosted, and their journey stalled hard.
[Alma 37:42] So they vibed in the wilderness way longer than needed, wandered off path, and caught mad hunger and thirst probs...all 'cause they messed up with sin.
[Alma 37:43] Listen up, son, these stories ain't just old tea; just like our dads got lazy ignoring the compass (which was just temporary), they tanked...and spiritual stuff works the same way, bet.
[Alma 37:44] Real talk, tuning into Christ's word that guides you straight to eternal bliss is just as easy as our ancestors following that compass to the promised land...say less.
[Alma 37:45] So, isn't this low-key symbolic? Just like that director led our dads to the promised land, if we ride with Christ's words, they'll carry us past this sad world into an even better place.
[Alma 37:46] Yo son, don't get lazy just 'cause the path looks easy; same trap our dads fell into. God set it up so if they looked, they'd live...and it's the same for us. The way's ready, just peep it and you'll live forever.
[Alma 37:47] Son, guard these sacred vibes, keep your eyes on God to stay alive. Hit up the people, drop the word, and stay chill. Peace out, my son.
[Alma 38:1] Son, listen up like I told Helaman...if you keep God's commands, you'll thrive out here; if not, you're gonna get ghosted from His presence, no cap.
[Alma 38:2] My son, low-key I'm hyped about your steady faith and loyalty to God; you started young looking up to Him, so bet you'll keep rocking His commands...blessed are those who hold it down till the end.
[Alma 38:3] Yo son, I've already been vibing hard with joy over your loyalty, grind, patience, and ability to deal with the Zoramites' drama...mad respect.
[Alma 38:4] I know you got locked up and even got stone-cold thrown at for spreading the word, but you held up 'cause the Lord had your back...and now you see He came through for you, no cap.
[Alma 38:5] Yo, Shiblon, remember this: the more you trust God, the more He'll pull you outta your struggles and pain, and you'll get that ultimate glow-up on the last day.
[Alma 38:6] Son, don't think I'm just flexing my own knowledge...it's the Spirit of God inside me dropping these truths; if I wasn't born of God, I'd be clueless, no cap.
[Alma 38:7] Real talk, the Lord, mad merciful, sent His angel to tell me to quit wrecking His people; I even saw that angel IRL, heard his voice boom like thunder shaking the whole earth...straight up wild.
[Alma 38:8] I spent three days straight in savage pain and soul-anguish, no relief until I begged Jesus for mercy; once I hit Him up, my sins got wiped and my soul finally chilled.
[Alma 38:9] Yo son, I'm spilling this so you catch the wisdom: no cap, the only way to be saved is through Christ. He's the life, the light, the realest truth and justice out here.
[Alma 38:10] Since you started dropping the word, keep the hustle going; stay sharp and balanced in everything you do, no slacking.
[Alma 38:11] Watch out for catching that pride vibe; don't flex your own smarts or mad strength like you're the main character, keep it humble.
[Alma 38:12] Be bold but don't come off toxic; keep your emotions in check so love fills you up, and for real, don't just sit around being lazy.
[Alma 38:13] Don't pray like the Zoramites, who just do it for clout and flex their "wisdom" to get props from people.
[Alma 38:14] Don't be that dude thanking God you're better than others; instead, say, "God forgive my flaws and show mercy to my bros," always keep it humble AF before God.
[Alma 38:15] May the Lord bless your soul and let you chill in His kingdom on the last day. Now bounce, son, and spread the word...stay woke. Peace out, my son.
[Alma 39:1] Yo son, got more to spill than I told your bro; have you peeped your brother's steady faith and grind on God's commandments? No cap, he's set a solid example for you.
[Alma 39:2] You didn't vibe with my words like your bro did with the Zoramites; here's the tea...I caught you flexing way too hard on your own strength and smarts.
[Alma 39:3] And it gets worse, son...you straight-up ghosted the ministry and dipped to Siron in Lamanite turf, chasing after that shady harlot Isabel.
[Alma 39:4] Yeah, she snatched hearts like a boss, but that ain't your pass, son. You were supposed to handle that ministry job given to you, no cap.
[Alma 39:5] Son, don't you know this stuff is straight-up abominable to the Lord? Like, top-tier bad, right after killing innocents or ghosting the Holy Spirit, no cap.
[Alma 39:6] Look, if you deny the Holy Ghost after it's already lit you up and you know you're doing it, that sin's unpardonable, no cap. And if you murder knowing God's truth? Forgiveness ain't coming easy, son, trust that.
[Alma 39:7] Yo son, I wish you hadn't messed up this bad. I wouldn't even bring it up if it didn't help you level up your soul, no cap.
[Alma 39:8] But real talk, you can't ghost your sins from God; if you don't repent, they'll be receipts dragging you on judgment day, no lie.
[Alma 39:9] Listen, son, I want you to repent, drop your sins, stop chasing eye candy, and check yourself in all this...no cap, if you don't, the kingdom of God is a no-go. Bet? Remember it, own it, and keep yourself in check.
[Alma 39:10] I'm telling you, roll with your older brothers for advice 'cause you're still young and need that fam support. For real, listen up and take their wisdom seriously.
[Alma 39:11] Don't let yourself get played by dumb stuff or let the devil reroute your heart to those wicked harlots again. Real talk, son, you brought mad drama on the Zoramites...your moves made them lowkey doubt my words.
[Alma 39:12] The Spirit's telling me to boss up and tell your crew to do good, or they'll drag a whole squad to ruin; so, son, in God's name, cut out your bad moves, no cap.
[Alma 39:13] Turn to the Lord full throttle...mind, might, strength...and stop dragging others into sin; instead, come back, own your mess, and admit the wrongs you pulled.
[Alma 39:14] Don't chase clout or shiny stuff 'cause news flash...you can't flex with that stuff in the afterlife, no cap.
[Alma 39:15] Yo son, heads up about Christ...he's def rolling through to wipe out the world's sins and drop the good news of salvation to his people, say less.
[Alma 39:16] So son, this is your gig...to flex these good vibes to the people, get their minds right, and set up their kids to catch the word when Christ pulls up.
[Alma 39:17] Lemme chill your brain a bit...you're shook why we gotta know this way ahead. Yo, every soul now is just as precious to God as it'll be when Christ shows up, no cap.
[Alma 39:18] For real, ain't it just as key for these people to get the redemption plan as it is for their kids? Say less.
[Alma 39:19] Low-key, isn't it just as easy now for God to send his angel to drop the good news on us as it will be for our kids or after Christ shows? Bet.
[Alma 40:1] Yo son, got more real talk for you 'cause I see your brain's stressing about the whole resurrection of the dead thing.
[Alma 40:2] Look, no resurrection...aka this mortal body doesn't level up to immortal, and this decay don't become incorrupt...until Christ makes his comeback, no cap.
[Alma 40:3] Yo, Christ's the one who's gonna flex the resurrection, but it's not lit yet. I'm spilling a secret, though plenty mysteries stay on God's VIP list. I done asked God hard just to get the tea on resurrection, and here it is.
[Alma 40:4] Bet, there's a set time when everyone's gonna rise from the dead, but no one's got the receipts on when...only God's got that info on lock.
[Alma 40:5] Whether it's one glow-up, or round two, or three times dead folks bounce back, IDGAF...God's got all that on lock, and knowing there's a set time for the squad to rise is enough for me.
[Alma 40:6] No cap, there's gotta be a gap between when you die and when you get resurrected.
[Alma 40:7] So, what's the move with souls from death until the resurrection time? Spill the tea.
[Alma 40:8] Doesn't matter if folks rise up more than once; they don't all ghost at the same time anyway. To God, it's all just one day...humans just gotta deal with the clock.
[Alma 40:9] So, there's a set time for folks to rise and a wait between death and resurrection. I asked God nonstop about what happens to souls during that gap, and now I got the receipts.
[Alma 40:10] When the big day drops and everyone's up, they'll realize God's been clocking all the timelines meant for us the whole time.
[Alma 40:11] So, about souls between death and resurrection...an angel clued me in that the spirits, good or sus, bounce straight to God who gifted them life as soon as they dip from the body.
[Alma 40:12] Then the righteous spirits get VIP access to happiness...aka paradise...where it's pure chill, no stress, no drama, just straight-up peace and rest from all the worries and pain.
[Alma 40:13] The wicked spirits, straight-up evil and no cap without God's Spirit cause they picked bad vibes over good, get possessed by the devil's rizz and end up booted to outer darkness, crying and grinding teeth, all their own mess locking them down.
[Alma 40:14] So yeah, the wicked souls sit in darkness, low-key shook, waiting on God's fierce wrath to drop, chilling there just like the righteous are in paradise, until resurrection time rolls around.
[Alma 40:15] Some peeps say the soul's pre-resurrection happiness or misery is like a first resurrection; I'm down with calling it that...it's like the spirit getting raised and assigned heaven or hell vibes based on what's been said.
[Alma 40:16] Also, heads up...there's talk of a first resurrection for everyone who ever lived or will, all the way up to Christ's own comeback from the dead.
[Alma 40:17] But real talk, this first resurrection talk ain't about souls getting assigned happiness or misery; don't get it twisted, that's not the move here.
[Alma 40:18] Nah fam, it means the soul linking back up with the body, for everyone from Adam's time up to when Christ rises.
[Alma 40:19] IDK if the wicked and righteous reunite with their bodies all at once, but trust me, they all come up before the resurrection of those who die after Christ's comeback.
[Alma 40:20] Look, I'm not saying their resurrection's exactly at Christ's, but I vibe that the righteous get soul-body reunion when Christ rises and jets to heaven.
[Alma 40:21] Whether it's at Christ's resurrection or later, I'm not spilling the tea, but for real there's a gap between death and the body's resurrection where souls vibe in happiness or misery until God's set time to reunite them and bring 'em before Him for judgment based on their deeds.
[Alma 40:22] Bet, this whole reunion thing is just the prophets' predictions coming through like some next-level restoration.
[Alma 40:23] The soul links back to the body, the body's reunited with the soul, every limb and joint locked in place...no cap, even a single hair gets its glow-up, everything back to perfect OG condition.
[Alma 40:24] Yo my son, this restoration flex is straight from the prophets' mouths, no cap.
[Alma 40:25] Then the righteous gonna glow up big time flexing in God's kingdom, no lie.
[Alma 40:26] But watch out, the wicked catch a savage death...they ghost on all things righteous 'cause they're straight-up unclean, and no sus vibes allowed in God's kingdom; they get tossed out to reap the nasty fruits of their own evil hustle, downing the bitterest cup, no cap.
[Alma 41:1] Yo my son, gotta clear up this restoration talk 'cause some peeps twisted the scriptures and went hella off-track; I know it's been messing with your head, so say less, I got you with the real talk.
[Alma 41:2] Listen up, my son...restoration gotta sync with God's justice; everything needs to get back on the real, 'cause by Christ's resurrection power, souls link back to their bodies and every part gets reunited fair and square.
[Alma 41:3] For real, God's justice demands folks get judged by their actions; if they vibed with good deeds and pure heart wants, then on the final day they bounce back to all things good.
[Alma 41:4] If their deeds are sus and evil, they get that energy back...everything gets restored right; mortality flips to immortality, corruption to incorruption, ending in endless happiness in God's kingdom or eternal misery in the devil's crib...one side or the other, no cap.
[Alma 41:5] The one who chased happiness and good vibes gets that W, while the one who vibed with evil all day catches that L when night falls...your rewards match your desires, no cap.
[Alma 41:6] On the flip side, if someone clapped back from their sins and chased right vibes till the end, they're getting that righteous reward, no cap.
[Alma 41:7] These peeps are the Lord's VIPs, saved from that eternal dark mode; they're the ones holding the controller, deciding if they flex good or go sus with evil.
[Alma 41:8] God's rules are locked in...no edits allowed...so the path is set for anyone ready to walk it and secure that salvation bag.
[Alma 41:9] Yo son, stop risking more drama against God by messing with these doctrines you've low-key been sinning on already...no cap, cut that out.
[Alma 41:10] Don't get it twisted just 'cause restoration's in the mix...you ain't bouncing from sin to true happiness; real talk, wickedness was never the plug for joy.
[Alma 41:11] Low-key, anyone stuck in their carnal vibes is trapped in bitter feels and sin chains, ghosted by God and totally off the happiness grid 'cause they're moving against God's nature.
[Alma 41:12] So, does restoration mean flipping something natural into unnatural or straight-up opposite to how it's meant to be? Say less, that ain't the move.
[Alma 41:13] Nah son, restoration means swapping evil for evil, carnal for carnal, devilish for devilish; and good for good, righteous for righteous, just for just, merciful for merciful...keeping the vibes consistent.
[Alma 41:14] So son, flex mercy on your crew, keep it 100 with justice, judge right, and keep doing good nonstop; do that and your rewards hit back...mercy, justice, righteous judgment, and good vibes all come back to you, no cap.
[Alma 41:15] Whatever energy you put out bounces right back, so restoration's low-key calling out sinners hard and doesn't cut them any slack, no cap.
[Alma 42:1] Yo son, I see you're stressed, confused about how God's justice punishes sinners...thinking it's sus that sinners get stuck in misery.
[Alma 42:2] Alright son, listen up: after God booted our OGs from Eden to grind the soil, He posted cherubim with a flaming sword at the garden's east gate, guarding the tree of life like a full-on security flex.
[Alma 42:3] So man got that God-level knowledge of good and evil, but to stop him from snatching life forever, God threw up cherubim and a flaming sword as lockdown...no fruit pass for immortality.
[Alma 42:4] So peep this: humans got a timeout to repent...a probation period to switch up and serve God before it's game over.
[Alma 42:5] Bet, if Adam snatched that tree of life ASAP, he'd live forever with zero chance to repent, straight cancelling God's word and totally wrecking the whole salvation plan.
[Alma 42:6] But hey, death was the deal for humans...kicked from the tree of life, banned from Earth's VIP, turning us into lost, fallen humans, no cap.
[Alma 42:7] So yeah, our OGs got ghosted temporally and spiritually from God's presence, which basically let them run wild chasing their own vibes.
[Alma 42:8] Real talk, bringing humans back from temporary death would've low-key busted the whole happiness plan, so it wasn't the move.
[Alma 42:9] So since souls can't die and the fall dropped spiritual AND temporal death on everyone...meaning we got ghosted by God...it was necessary to pull humanity back from that spiritual dead zone.
[Alma 42:10] Since people went full carnal, sensual, and devilish by default, this probation period was the setup phase...a prep zone to get ready for what's next.
[Alma 42:11] Yo son, remember if the redemption plan didn't exist, souls dipped right into misery after death, fully ghosted from God's presence, no cap.
[Alma 42:12] And straight up, there was no way to save humans from this fallen mess since they got themselves into it by playing disobedient.
[Alma 42:13] So, justice said the redemption plan only works if humans repent during this probation phase; without that, mercy would wreck justice's grind...and messing with justice means God stops being God, no cap.
[Alma 42:14] So yeah, everyone fell and got caught up in God's justice, which basically put them on permanent timeout, cut off from His squad forever.
[Alma 42:15] The mercy plan was dead in the water without atonement, so God Himself took the L for the world's sins to make mercy happen, balance justice's receipts, and keep flexin' as both fair and merciful.
[Alma 42:16] Repentance ain't possible without a punishment...one that's eternal like the soul...clashing directly with the happiness plan, which is also forever, no cap.
[Alma 42:17] Like, how you gonna repent if you never sin? And how you gonna sin without laws? Laws only work 'cause punishments exist...say less.
[Alma 42:18] So yeah, a punishment was set and a fair law dropped, making people feel that deep guilt and remorse in their soul.
[Alma 42:19] But if no law said "murder means death," would anyone actually sweat dying for murder? Big nope.
[Alma 42:20] Plus, if there was no law flexing against sin, people wouldn't even worry about catching those sins, straight up.
[Alma 42:21] And without laws, if people sinned, what could justice or mercy even do? They'd have zero receipts on anyone, no cap.
[Alma 42:22] But there's a law, a set punishment, and a chance to repent...mercy grabs that chance; if not, justice snatches the person, drops the law's hammer, and if that fails, justice breaks down and God ain't God no more.
[Alma 42:23] God never loses His God-ness, mercy grabs the repentant 'cause of the atonement; that atonement sparks the dead's resurrection, pulling folks back to God's presence to get judged straight up by their works and justice.
[Alma 42:24] Justice collects all its receipts, mercy grabs what's hers, so only the real-deal repentant get that W and get saved.
[Alma 42:25] You really think mercy can snatch justice's drip? Nah fam, not even a little; if that happened, God wouldn't be God no more.
[Alma 42:26] So God's been running the ultimate eternal plan since day one, making salvation, redemption, and yeah, destruction and misery all part of the same big picture.
[Alma 42:27] So listen up, son...anyone can roll up and drink the waters of life for free; if you ghost, no cap, you're not forced, but on the last day, you get back what you put in.
[Alma 42:28] If someone chooses to vibe with evil and never hits the repentance button, watch...the same evil energy bounces back to them, straight up God's restoration.
[Alma 42:29] Yo son, don't stress over all this mess...just let your sins mess with you enough to pull that repentance move, say less.
[Alma 42:30] Yo son, stop fronting and denying God's justice; don't low-key try to excuse your sins by clapping back at it...let God's justice, mercy, and patience run wild in your heart and humble you to the ground.
[Alma 42:31] Alright son, God's calling you to preach straight facts to the people. Go out, drop truth with seriousness, pull souls toward repentance so mercy can flex on them. May God bless you exactly as I said. Amen.
[Alma 43:1] So the sons of Alma rolled out to spit the word to the crowd, and even Alma couldn't chill...he had to roll out too.
[Alma 43:2] No cap, they preached straight up truth and prophecy vibes, all in line with God's holy squad calling.
[Alma 43:3] Back to the tea on the Nephites vs. Lamanites war, dropping in the 18th year of the judges' reign.
[Alma 43:4] So the Zoramites switched sides to the Lamanites, and at the start of year 18, the Nephites caught the Lamanites rolling up, so they flexed hard and packed their armies in Jershon, ready to throw down.
[Alma 43:5] The Lamanites rolled in with thousands, hitting Antionum...Zoramite turf...with Zerahemnah as their main dude leading the charge.
[Alma 43:6] Since the Amalekites were straight-up more savage and murderous than the Lamanites, Zerahemnah made his top bosses all Amalekites and Zoramites...no cap, ruthless squad.
[Alma 43:7] He did that to keep their beef with the Nephites lit, aiming to flex control and execute his plans.
[Alma 43:8] His whole move was to hype the Lamanites' rage at the Nephites, so he could snag mad power over his squad and also enslave the Nephites...big power grab, no cap.
[Alma 43:9] The Nephites' plan? Hold down their land, crib, fam, and kids, keep haters off them, protect their rights and freedom, and vibe with God how they want.
[Alma 43:10] They knew if the Lamanites caught them, anyone repping real, heartfelt worship of the true God was straight-up doomed.
[Alma 43:11] They low-key knew the Lamanites hated their Anti-Nephi-Lehi fam, aka the people of Ammon, who swore off weapons and kept a solid covenant...so if caught, they'd get wiped out for real.
[Alma 43:12] The Nephites weren't about letting them catch these L's, so they handed over lands as their squad's safe zone.
[Alma 43:13] The people of Ammon donated mad resources to back the Nephites' armies, so the Nephites had to solo against the Lamanites...a messy mix of Laman, Lemuel, Ishmael's crew, plus Amalekites, Zoramites, and Noah's priest fam who dipped from the Nephites.
[Alma 43:14] Those descendants were almost as many as the Nephites, so the Nephites had no choice but to throw hands with their own kin, straight-up bloody vibes.
[Alma 43:15] When the Lamanite armies stacked up in Antionum, the Nephites were ready to throw down in Jershon...say less, battle imminent.
[Alma 43:16] The Nephites' main boss, the chief captain running the whole army, was Moroni...guy had main-character energy for real.
[Alma 43:17] Moroni flexed full control over war ops at just 25 years old...young boss with serious rizz on the battlefield.
[Alma 43:18] Moroni pulled up to Jershon's border, squad strapped with swords, scimitars, and every war tool you can imagine...ready to clap back.
[Alma 43:19] When the Lamanites peeped that Moroni's crew was rocking breastplates, arm-shields, head armor, and thick threads, they low-key caught the serious armor flex.
[Alma 43:20] Zerahemnah's army was straight-up sus, only packing swords, scimitars, bows, arrows, stones, and slings...rocking nothing but loincloths, totally exposed, except the Zoramites and Amalekites who had a bit more drip.
[Alma 43:21] No breastplates or shields on their side, so even with way more numbers, Zerahemnah's crew low-key feared the Nephite armor flex hard.
[Alma 43:22] They were too scared to pull up on the Nephites at Jershon, so they dipped from Antionum into the wilderness, trying to sneak around Sidon's head into Manti, thinking Moroni's crew wouldn't catch the move.
[Alma 43:23] As soon as they bounced into the wilderness, Moroni sent spies to creep on their camp; also, knowing Alma's prophecies, he hit Alma up to check with the Lord on where the Nephite armies should move to block the Lamanites.
[Alma 43:24] The Lord hit Alma with the 411, and Alma told Moroni's messengers the Lamanites were sneaking through the wilderness aiming to ambush the weaker spot in Manti...messengers then slid that tea to Moroni.
[Alma 43:25] Moroni left some troops holding down Jershon, so no Lamanites could sneak in and claim the city, then took the rest of his army and marched straight into Manti.
[Alma 43:26] Moroni got everyone in that area to squad up and flex hard, ready to defend their lands, rights, and freedoms...so they were locked and loaded before the Lamanites showed up.
[Alma 43:27] Moroni low-key hid his army in a valley by the west bank of the river Sidon, deep in the wilderness...perfect for a surprise move.
[Alma 43:28] Moroni stationed spies all around to get the receipts on when the Lamanite camp would pull up.
[Alma 43:29] Moroni caught the Lamanites' whole agenda: either wipe out their own kin or enslave them to build their own kingdom over everything...major sus energy.
[Alma 43:30] Knowing the Nephites just wanted to save their lands, freedom, and church, Moroni figured it's totally chill to use some clever moves...so he used spies to track the Lamanites' route.
[Alma 43:31] So Moroni split his squad, sending some deep into the valley, hiding them east and south of Hill Riplah...strategic AF.
[Alma 43:32] The rest he tucked away in the west valley, west of river Sidon, stretching down to Manti's borders...total stealth mode.
[Alma 43:33] With his squad set exactly how he wanted, Moroni was ready to clap back when they showed up.
[Alma 43:34] Then the Lamanites rolled up north of the hill, right where part of Moroni's army was low-key hiding.
[Alma 43:35] Once the Lamanites crossed hill Riplah into the valley and started crossing river Sidon, Lehi and his hidden squad south of the hill popped out and circled the Lamanites from the east and behind...big brain move.
[Alma 43:36] When the Lamanites spotted the Nephites sneaking up behind, they flipped the script and started throwing hands with Lehi's crew.
[Alma 43:37] The fight got savage on both sides, but the Lamanites caught the worst...bare skin got sliced up bad by the Nephites' swords and scimitars, dropping bodies left and right.
[Alma 43:38] Meanwhile, Nephites took a few L's here and there, but their armor...breastplates, armshields, head-plates...kept the vital spots locked down, so they kept dishing out death on the Lamanites like pros.
[Alma 43:39] The Lamanites got shook seeing all the chaos and bodies dropping, so they started booking it towards river Sidon real quick.
[Alma 43:40] Lehi and his squad chased them hard, pushing the Lamanites into river Sidon's waters, and then held the line on the bank so no one slipped past.
[Alma 43:41] Moroni and his crew caught the Lamanites in the valley across river Sidon and started wrecking them, slaying left and right.
[Alma 43:42] The Lamanites dipped once more, heading for Manti, but Moroni's armies pulled up again to block their escape.
[Alma 43:43] Low-key, the Lamanites went all out this time...like, never before had they flexed that much strength and guts since day one, no cap.
[Alma 43:44] Fueled by their hype squad...the Zoramites, Amalekites, and top dog Zerahemnah...the Lamanites fought like straight-up dragons, shredding Nephites by breaking helmets, piercing armor, and chopping off arms in pure savage rage.
[Alma 43:45] But the Nephites had that main-character energy...fighting not for crowns or clout, but for their homes, freedom, fam, and their sacred worship vibes. Say less.
[Alma 43:46] They were just doing their duty to God, 'cause the Lord told them and their forebears straight up: if you didn't start beef, don't let your enemies clap you.
[Alma 43:47] Plus, God said: protect your fam even if it means spilling some blood. So the Nephites were straight up fighting the Lamanites to guard their people, land, rights, and faith...no cap.
[Alma 43:48] When Moroni's guys caught the Lamanites flexing that savage rage, they almost dipped, but Moroni peeped their vibes and hyped them up, reminding them it was all about their land, freedom, and breaking free from chains.
[Alma 43:49] So they flipped the script on the Lamanites and all shouted as one to God, begging for their freedom and a straight-up break from their chains.
[Alma 43:50] They stood firm, flexing mad power, and right when they prayed for freedom, the Lamanites started running scared all the way back to Sidon's waters.
[Alma 43:51] The Lamanites outnumbered the Nephites by like double, but still got pushed so hard they had to squad up tight in the valley by the Sidon riverbank.
[Alma 43:52] So Moroni's armies straight-up surrounded them, banking both sides of the river, with Lehi's crew holding down the east side.
[Alma 43:53] When Zerahemnah spotted Lehi's squad east of Sidon and Moroni's crew west, realizing they were totally surrounded by Nephites, he got hit with major panic vibes.
[Alma 43:54] Moroni peeped their freakout and told his crew to chill with the bloodshed, hold up.
[Alma 44:1] So they pulled back a bit, and Moroni hit up Zerahemnah: Look, we ain't trying to be bloodthirsty. You're caught, but we ain't about that slaughter life.
[Alma 44:2] Yo, we ain't here to flex by spilling your blood or to throw anyone under slavery's yoke. You came at us for real 'cause of your hate for our religion, no cap.
[Alma 44:3] Check it, God's got our back and just handed you over to us. This beef's 'cause of our faith in Christ, and now you see no way to wipe out what we believe.
[Alma 44:4] Look, this is the real deal faith...God's holding us down and protecting us as long as we stay loyal to Him and our religion; He won't let us get wrecked unless we throw in the towel and ditch our beliefs.
[Alma 44:5] Zerahemnah, I order you, in the name of the all-powerful God who powered up our arms to flex on you...through our faith, religion, worship, squad, the ride-or-die love for our wives and kids, the freedom that locks us to our land and country, and the sacred Word of God that's our true happiness, and everything we hold tight...
[Alma 44:6] And wait, there's more...by everything you want in life, I command you to drop your weapons, and we won't hunt your blood; we'll spare you if you bounce and don't come back throwing hands at us.
[Alma 44:7] But if you ghost on this, you're locked in our grip, and I'll tell my squad to clap back hard, leaving you dead, wiped out...then we'll see who really runs this crew and who ends up in chains.
[Alma 44:8] So Zerahemnah heard all that and rolled up, handing over his sword, scimitar, and bow to Moroni, saying: Here's our war gear; we'll drop them but ain't taking any oaths 'cause we know we'll break 'em, and so will our kids. Let us bounce to the wilderness, or we keep our swords and it's either die or win for us.
[Alma 44:9] Look, we don't roll with your faith; we're not buying that God dropped us in your lap ... we think your slick moves saved you from our blades. Honestly, it's your armor and shields keeping you alive.
[Alma 44:10] When Zerahemnah finished his rant, Moroni tossed back the sword and war gear, saying: Bet, we're done with this beef.
[Alma 44:11] I don't remember exactly what I said before, but for real, by the Lord's life, you ain't leaving without vowing not to come back and start beef again. Since you're caught, we either drench the ground with your blood or you accept my terms.
[Alma 44:12] Moroni dropped those words, but Zerahemnah clutched his sword mad salty, charging to kill Moroni; just as he swung, one of Moroni's bros smashed his sword to the ground, broke it at the hilt, and scalped Zerahemnah...his head literally hit the floor. Then Zerahemnah dipped back into his squad.
[Alma 44:13] Then the soldier who clapped Zerahemnah's scalp picked it up by the hair, stuck it on his sword tip, and held it up to the crowd yelling loud:
[Alma 44:14] Just like this scalp hit the ground...the chief's scalp...you all will fall too if you don't drop your weapons and peace out with a promise.
[Alma 44:15] Tons freaked out hearing this and seeing the scalp on the sword; loads dropped their weapons at Moroni's feet and made peace deals. Everyone who signed got to bounce into the wilderness safe and sound.
[Alma 44:16] Zerahemnah got super salty and hyped up his remaining troops to throw down even harder against the Nephites.
[Alma 44:17] Moroni got heated over the Lamanites' stubborn flex, so he told his squad to go full send and kill. And they did...while the Lamanites fought back hard with swords and pure rage.
[Alma 44:18] But low-key, with their skin and heads wide open, the Lamanites got sliced up bad by Nephite swords, dropping like flies way faster than expected...just like Moroni's soldier said they would.
[Alma 44:19] Seeing his squad about to get wiped, Zerahemnah begged Moroni hard, promising he and his crew would peace out forever if they let them live...no more war vibes, no cap.
[Alma 44:20] So Moroni called off the killin' spree, took the Lamanites' weapons, and once they promised peace, let them bounce into the wilderness.
[Alma 44:21] Dead bodies stacked so high on both sides...Nephites and Lamanites...that counting them was a straight-up impossible flex.
[Alma 44:22] So they tossed their dead into the Sidon waters, and the bodies dipped deep, buried in the ocean's depths.
[Alma 44:23] Moroni's Nephite squad rolled back, heading home to their crib and turf.
[Alma 44:24] That wrapped up year eighteen of the judges' reign over Nephi's crew, and with it, the record Alma dropped on the plates of Nephi came to a close.
[Alma 45:1] The Nephi squad was straight-up hyped, God rolled through and saved them again from their haters; so they went full-on with fasting, mad prayers, and worship lit with big-time joy.
[Alma 45:2] In year nineteen of the judges' reign, Alma hit up his son Helaman and was like, "You still vibing with what I told you about those records they've been keeping?"
[Alma 45:3] Helaman replied, "Bet, I'm down with it, I believe."
[Alma 45:4] Alma doubled down and asked, "You really believe in Jesus Christ, the one who's gonna show up?"
[Alma 45:5] Helaman was like, "Yeah, I'm all in on everything you said, no cap."
[Alma 45:6] Alma came back with, "You gonna stick to my commandments for real?"
[Alma 45:7] Helaman said straight up, "Bet, I'll keep your commandments 100%, heart and soul."
[Alma 45:8] Alma told him, "You're blessed, no cap, and the Lord's gonna bless your grind in this land."
[Alma 45:9] Alma said, "Look, I gotta drop some prophecy on you...but keep it on the DL till it happens; no leaks allowed...so write down everything I tell you."
[Alma 45:10] Alma said, "Peep this: I see, via the spirit inside me, that in 400 years after Jesus shows up to the Nephites, their faith's gonna low-key fade into unbelief."
[Alma 45:11] For real, then they'll catch mad wars, plagues, famines, and hella bloodshed, straight up till the Nephites go extinct...no cap.
[Alma 45:12] Yeah, it's cuz they'll fade in faith and trip hard into dark vibes, wild sinning, and all kinds of mess; no cap, since they ignore mad knowledge, by the fourth gen this chaos will be full-on lit.
[Alma 45:13] When that big day drops, real talk, soon those who are Nephites now...or their fam...won't even be counted as part of the Nephite crew no more.
[Alma 45:14] But whoever survives that savage day won't be Nephites no more...they'll roll with the Lamanites and vibe like them, except a rare few called the Lord's disciples, who the Lamanites will chase down til they vanish. This prophecy's locked in thanks to all the sinning.
[Alma 45:15] So after dropping all that knowledge to Helaman, Alma blessed him and his bros, and even gave a shoutout blessing to the earth for the righteous peeps.
[Alma 45:16] He said, "God's word: This land's cursed to destruction for every nation and crew that go full wicked once they're ripe; no cap, that's God's deal...blessing or cursing...'cause the Lord ain't about lettin' sin slide even a little."
[Alma 45:17] After saying all that, Alma blessed the whole church...everyone who stays solid in faith from then on, no cap.
[Alma 45:18] After that, Alma dipped from Zarahemla like he was heading to Melek...and then? Radio silence. No one heard a peep about his death or grave, full mystery vibes.
[Alma 45:19] Fact is, Alma was mad righteous; the church spread rumors he got taken up by the Spirit or buried by God's hand like Moses. Scriptures say God grabbed Moses, so we figure Alma got ghosted into the spirit too...hence no tea on his death or grave.
[Alma 45:20] So, at the start of year 19 in the judges' reign over the Nephites, Helaman rolled out to drop the word to the people, say less.
[Alma 45:21] With all the beef and runs-in with Lamanites, plus lowkey drama in their squad, it was clear they needed God's word spread and some rules set across the church, no cap.
[Alma 45:22] So Helaman and his crew bounced out to reboot the church everywhere across Nephite cities, and they put priests and teachers on deck to run all the churches, no cap.
[Alma 45:23] After Helaman and his squad hooked up priests and teachers, drama popped off...people started beefing and straight up ignored Helaman and his crew's words, sus move.
[Alma 45:24] They caught major pride vibes flexing on their insane riches, thinking they were top-tier, so they ghosted Helaman's squad and dipped from walking right with God.
[Alma 46:1] So everyone who ignored Helaman and his crew started squadting up against their own peeps, big sus energy.
[Alma 46:2] They got mad heated, like full-on rage mode, ready to straight up take them out, no cap.
[Alma 46:3] The main dude flexing anger against his own was a big, buff guy named Amalickiah, main-character energy but sus.
[Alma 46:4] Amalickiah was low-key thirsty for king status, and the angry crowd, mostly low-tier judges craving clout, were all about making him their king...big power vibes.
[Alma 46:5] They got played by Amalickiah's sweet talk...he promised that if they backed him as king, they'd get boss-level roles over the people. Total rizz move.
[Alma 46:6] So Amalickiah low-key dragged them into beef, ignoring Helaman's crew preaching and their serious grind as high priests keeping the church tight. Major receipts of sus.
[Alma 46:7] Plenty in the church bought Amalickiah's smooth talk and dipped from the squad, making Nephite life low-key shaky and risky...even after that big Lamanite W and their hype celebrations for God's save.
[Alma 46:8] This just shows how fast humans ghost God, jump into bad moves, and get played by the evil one...no cap, quick to dip into sin.
[Alma 46:9] Deadass, one seriously wicked dude can mess up a whole crew's vibe and spark major chaos among people.
[Alma 46:10] Amalickiah was mad slick with his smooth talk and sneaky plans, leading many hearts astray to do evil, trying to wreck God's church and tear down the freedom God blessed the land with for the good folks.
[Alma 46:11] So Moroni, the head honcho of Nephite armies, caught wind of this beef and was straight-up heated at Amalickiah.
[Alma 46:12] Moroni ripped his jacket, snagged a piece, and wrote on it...In honor of God, our faith, freedom, peace, and fam...then slapped it on a pole like a boss move.
[Alma 46:13] Moroni strapped on his helmet, breastplate, and shields, tied his armor tight, grabbed the pole with his ripped jacket dubbed the title of liberty, then bowed low and prayed hard for freedom to vibe with his people as long as any Christians held the land.
[Alma 46:14] Real believers in Christ, part of God's squad, got tagged as that by the outsiders who weren't in the church.
[Alma 46:15] The church crew stayed loyal; every real believer rocked the name of Christ...Christians...proudly 'cause they had mad faith in the Christ to come.
[Alma 46:16] So Moroni straight-up prayed for the Christians' cause and the land's freedom to get some serious blessings and good vibes.
[Alma 46:17] After pouring his heart out to God, Moroni dubbed all the land south of Desolation...and honestly everywhere north and south...a chosen spot, the ultimate land of liberty.
[Alma 46:18] Moroni said: No way God lets us, who get clowned for reppin' Christ, get crushed and wiped out unless we mess up big time ourselves...no cap.
[Alma 46:19] After dropping those words, Moroni hit the crowd, waving his ripped jacket piece high so everyone could peep the message, shouting loud AF:
[Alma 46:20] Listen up: anyone down to hold up this title over the land, roll through with God's power and swear to keep their rights and faith, so the Lord can bless them big time.
[Alma 46:21] When Moroni shouted that, the people sprinted up, armor on and ripping their clothes as a serious promise: they wouldn't ditch God, and if they ever slipped and felt too sus to rep Christ, God would tear them up just like they tore their gear.
[Alma 46:22] This was the deal they made, tossing their clothes at Moroni's feet saying: We swear to God we'll get wrecked like our northern bros if we mess up; He can hand us over to our enemies just like we threw our clothes down to be trampled if we flop.
[Alma 46:23] Moroni told them: Yo, we're the leftover crew from Jacob's lineage, straight from Joseph whose bros tore his coat to shreds; so let's not forget to vibe with God's rules or else our clothes get ripped, and we end up locked up, sold out, or straight killed.
[Alma 46:24] Yeah, let's guard our freedom like true Joseph leftovers and keep Jacob's final words on lock...he noticed a scrap of Joseph's torn coat stayed fresh, saying just like that piece survived, God's got a remnant of Joseph's fam on lock, taking them in while the rest fade away like that ragged cloth.
[Alma 46:25] This low-key breaks my soul, but I'm hyped for my son 'cause part of his fam is gonna be snatched up by God, no cap.
[Alma 46:26] Just so you know, these were Jacob's exact words, no cap.
[Alma 46:27] Who's to say the Joseph leftovers that get wrecked like his coat aren't the ones who dipped from us? Bet, it could even be us if we don't hold tight to Christ's faith.
[Alma 46:28] After Moroni dropped that, he rolled out and sent word everywhere the beef was, pulling together all freedom-lovers ready to clap back at Amalickiah and his crew, the Amalickiahites.
[Alma 46:29] When Amalickiah peeped that Moroni's squad was way bigger and his own crew was low-key sus about their cause, he got spooked and dipped with whoever was down to Nephi's turf, fearing the L was coming.
[Alma 46:30] Moroni wasn't about letting the Lamanites level up, so he planned to snatch Amalickiah's crew, bring them back, and off Amalickiah himself...he knew the dude would hype up the Lamanites for war just to flex his agenda.
[Alma 46:31] So Moroni figured it made sense to roll out with his fully geared-up, peace-sworn army, pitching tents in the wilderness to block Amalickiah's path and cut him off.
[Alma 46:32] Moroni straight-up did his thing, marched deep into the wilderness, and put himself bossing up against Amalickiah's armies.
[Alma 46:33] Amalickiah dipped with a tiny squad, while Moroni snagged the rest and hauled them back to Zarahemla.
[Alma 46:34] Moroni was the plug, chosen by top judges and the people's vote, so he had full boss energy over the Nephite armies to run the show however he wanted.
[Alma 46:35] Anyone from the Amalickiahites who ghosted the freedom pact got the chop...Moroni was no joke...and tbh, only a small squad denied the freedom vibes.
[Alma 46:36] Moroni flexed the title of liberty on every Nephite tower across the land, planting the freedom flag loud and clear.
[Alma 46:37] Peace vibes bounced back across the land, and they kept that chill flow going till almost the end of year nineteen under the judges' reign.
[Alma 46:38] Helaman and the high priests kept the church squad tight, and for four years straight it was pure peace and hype in the holy crew.
[Alma 46:39] Loads of folks died clutching the faith that Jesus had their souls covered, so they bounced from this world straight-up rejoicing.
[Alma 46:40] Some peeps caught fevers...seasonal AF in the land...but not too bad thanks to all the dope plants and roots God dropped to fight off those climate-induced sick vibes.
[Alma 46:41] Plenty clocked out from old age, and for those who stuck with faith in Christ, they're vibing happily with him...no doubt about it.
[Alma 47:1] Back to Amalickiah and his crew who bounced into the wilderness...guy rolled up into Nephi land, stirred mad drama with the Lamanites, making their king flex a full-on call to squad up and clap back at the Nephites.
[Alma 47:2] When the king's hype went out, everyone caught serious fear...no one wanted to upset the king but also nobody was down to die fighting the Nephites...so most low-key noped out on following his orders.
[Alma 47:3] The king caught mad rage over their disobedience, so he handed Amalickiah the wheel of the loyal army and told him to go flex hard and force everyone to suit up for battle.
[Alma 47:4] Peep this: Amalickiah was low-key scheming...guy was smooth evil energy, plotting straight up to snatch the Lamanite king's crown.
[Alma 47:5] Amalickiah scored command over the king's loyal Lamanites and then tried to win over the disobedient ones; he rolled up to Onidah, where all the Lamanites dipped, thinking the army was coming to wipe them out, so they stashed at the arms base.
[Alma 47:6] They crowned a new king and leader, dead set on not getting forced to fight the Nephites...no cap, they were locked in on that move.
[Alma 47:7] So they squad up at the peak of Mount Antipas, readying for the battle hype.
[Alma 47:8] Amalickiah ain't really tryna fight like the king ordered; he's playing for clout with the Lamanite troops to snatch the crown and boot the king off the throne.
[Alma 47:9] So Amalickiah had his squad camp out lowkey in the valley right by Mount Antipas.
[Alma 47:10] Nighttime rolls up, Amalickiah sends a sneaky envoy up Mount Antipas, texting Lehonti...the top dog there...to slide down for a lowkey convo.
[Alma 47:11] Lehonti got the msg but was too sus to roll down the mount; Amalickiah hit him up twice more, but Lehonti still ghosted the meet.
[Alma 47:12] When Amalickiah saw Lehonti was straight ghosting, he flexed up the mount near Lehonti's camp and slid a fourth message...come down, bring your guards, say less.
[Alma 47:13] When Lehonti rolled down with his guards, Amalickiah pitched the plan: slide in at night, surround the king's troops, hand 'em over to Lehonti, and in return, make Amalickiah second-in-command of the whole army...big brain move.
[Alma 47:14] Lehonti pulled up with his crew, circled Amalickiah's men, so by dawn, they were straight-up boxed in by Lehonti's armies...sleep no more.
[Alma 47:15] Once they peeped they were boxed in, they begged Amalickiah to let them join their squad so they wouldn't get wiped...exactly the move Amalickiah was low-key aiming for.
[Alma 47:16] Amalickiah straight up handed over his dudes, breaking the king's orders, all to flex his plan to dethrone the king...no cap, this was his big play.
[Alma 47:17] The Lamanite mood was: if the main boss dies, the number two steps up as the new head honcho...standard protocol.
[Alma 47:18] Amalickiah low-key had one of his servants drip poison on Lehonti bit by bit until he finally checked out.
[Alma 47:19] Once Lehonti was donezo, the Lamanites crowned Amalickiah as their main boss and top commander...big W.
[Alma 47:20] With his vibes secured, Amalickiah marched his squads straight to the land and city of Nephi...the main hub, no cap.
[Alma 47:21] The king rolled out with his guards, thinking Amalickiah had kept it 100 and rallied a massive army to throw down against the Nephites...expecting full-on battle mode.
[Alma 47:22] But plot twist: as the king steps up, Amalickiah sends his servants to front, who bow low like they're mad respectful to the king's "greatness" ... big fake energy.
[Alma 47:23] The king reached out to lift them up...typical Lamanite peace move, which they low-key borrowed from the Nephites...say less on cultural exchange.
[Alma 47:24] As soon as he helped the first dude up, boom...stabbed the king right in the heart, and the king hit the ground hard.
[Alma 47:25] The king's crew dipped fast while Amalickiah's servants started yelling, hyping up the chaos.
[Alma 47:26] Yo, the king's own servants just stabbed him in the heart, he's down, and they straight dipped...come peep this tea.
[Alma 47:27] Amalickiah ordered his troops to roll up and check on the king; when they saw him bloody AF, Amalickiah played mad salty and flexed, saying anyone riding for the king should chase down those rats and cap 'em.
[Alma 47:28] So all the king's stans heard Amalickiah's call and bounced to chase after the king's own traitor squad.
[Alma 47:29] The king's crew saw an army chasing and got mad scared, bounced into the wild, crossed into Zarahemla, and linked up with Ammon's squad.
[Alma 47:30] The chasing army came back empty-handed, and Amalickiah low-key flexed his scam, winning over the people's hearts.
[Alma 47:31] Next day, Amalickiah rolled into Nephi with his armies and straight-up took over the city like a boss.
[Alma 47:32] So when the queen caught word the king got killed...Amalickiah's crew slid in with the tea saying the king was stabbed by his own servants, tried to chase them down with his army but nah, they ghosted...she got the full vibe check.
[Alma 47:33] So the queen hit Amalickiah back, asking him to chill and spare the city, inviting him over, and low-key requesting receipts with witnesses about how the king died.
[Alma 47:34] Amalickiah rolled up to the queen with the king's killer and crew, all confessing the king got stabbed by his own squad, saying "they ran off...doesn't that spill the tea?" Queen was low-key convinced.
[Alma 47:35] Amalickiah scored the queen's hand by playing sly, and with his crafty crew's help, he snatched the kingdom...no cap, everyone in Lamanite land (Lamanites, Lemuelites, Ishmaelites, and Nephite dropouts) called him king from Nephi's days to now.
[Alma 47:36] These Nephite dissidents, who had the same teachings and knew God just like the rest, ended up getting way more savage and stubborn than the Lamanites...caught up in Lamanite vibes, slacking off, wilding out, and straight-up ghosting God.
[Alma 48:1] As soon as Amalickiah snagged the crown, he started hyping up the Lamanites to throw shade at the Nephites, even putting speakers on towers to drop anti-Nephite rants.
[Alma 48:2] Amalickiah stirred up mad hate for the Nephites, and by year nineteen of the judges' reign, flexing as king of the Lamanites, he was hungry to boss up over the whole land...Nephites and Lamanites alike.
[Alma 48:3] Amalickiah hit his goal, pumping Lamanites' hearts to stone and fogging their minds, hyping them mad mad to squad up and roll against the Nephites.
[Alma 48:4] He was dead set, riding the wave of his massive crew, ready to steamroll the Nephites and lock them up in straight-up bondage.
[Alma 48:5] So Amalickiah made the Zoramites big boss captains since they knew the Nephites' flexes, hideouts, and weak spots best...put them in charge of his armies, no cap.
[Alma 48:6] They packed up their camp and bounced toward Zarahemla, heading deep into the wilderness.
[Alma 48:7] While Amalickiah was grinding lowkey shady to stack power, Moroni was over here leveling up the squad's faith game, keeping them loyal to God, no cap.
[Alma 48:8] Moroni was out here beefing up Nephite troops, dropping small forts and earth ramps, plus stone walls circling their cities and borders...lockdown mode all around the land.
[Alma 48:9] Moroni flexed his strategy by stacking most soldiers in the spots where the defense was sus, leveling up and locking down Nephite lands hard.
[Alma 48:10] He was gearing up to guard their freedom, turf, families, and peace, so they could live for God and keep repping what their haters called the "Christian cause."
[Alma 48:11] Moroni was big brain and strong AF; not about that bloodshed life, but his soul vibed hard with liberty and freedom for his country and fam, no cap.
[Alma 48:12] His heart was straight-up swelling with thanks to God for all the blessings dropped on his people; dude hustled crazy hard for their safety and well-being.
[Alma 48:13] Moroni was ride-or-die in his faith in Christ, swore on everything to protect his people, rights, country, and faith...even if it meant spilling his own blood, no cap.
[Alma 48:14] The Nephites got schooled to flex defense hard...even spilling blood if needed...but never to start beef or swing swords unless it's enemy time or they gotta save their own skins.
[Alma 48:15] Their vibe? Stay faithful to God's rules and God'll bless their land...either hooking them up with peace, a heads-up to dip, or a prep for war depending on the threat, say less.
[Alma 48:16] God would low-key drop the GPS on where to defend against enemies, and deliver them; Moroni's faith flexed on this...not hyped about bloodshed, but vibing on doing good, protecting his people, obeying God, and standing up to evil.
[Alma 48:17] No cap, if everyone was like Moroni...then hell's whole squad would be shook forever, and the devil wouldn't have any clout over human hearts, bet.
[Alma 48:18] For real, he was on the same level as Ammon, Mosiah's son, plus Mosiah's other sons and Alma's crew...straight-up men of God all around.
[Alma 48:19] Helaman and his bros were just as clutch for the people as Moroni; they spread God's word and baptized anyone ready to listen and repent, no cap.
[Alma 48:20] So they rolled out, and the people got low-key humble from their words, catching mad blessings from the Lord, keeping peace on lock...no beef...for a whole four years straight.
[Alma 48:21] But like I said, by year nineteen end, even with their chill vibes, they had no choice but to throw hands against their own fam, the Lamanites...reluctantly, no cap.
[Alma 48:22] Yeah, straight up, their beef with the Lamanites kept going non-stop for years, even though they low-key didn't want the smoke.
[Alma 48:23] Real talk, they hated picking fights with the Lamanites 'cause bloodshed wasn't their vibe; plus, they felt bad sending so many bros out unready to face God in the afterlife.
[Alma 48:24] Still, they couldn't just ghost on protecting their fam from the savage cruelty of ex-brethren who dipped from the church and linked up with the Lamanites to wreck them.
[Alma 48:25] Nah, they couldn't stand their own bros hyping over Nephite blood as long as anyone was still grinding to keep God's commandments...'cause God promised those who stayed loyal would thrive in the land.
[Alma 49:1] So, by month eleven, day ten, year nineteen, the Lamanite armies pulled up near Ammonihah like they were ready to throw down.
[Alma 49:2] Peep this: the city got rebuilt, Moroni posted troops at its edges, and they threw up dirt walls to block Lamanites' arrows and rocks...'cause yeah, those dudes were throwing hands with stones and arrows.
[Alma 49:3] Look, I said Ammonihah was rebuilt...but only kinda; since the Lamanites wrecked it before 'cause the people were sus, they figured it'd be an easy win again.
[Alma 49:4] But man, they got hit with a major L...'cause the Nephites built a fat dirt wall all around so high the Lamanites couldn't land their arrows or stones, and could only roll up through the one spot they came in.
[Alma 49:5] At this point, the Lamanite chief captains were shook big time, mad impressed by the Nephites flexing serious brainpower in setting up their fort vibes.
[Alma 49:6] The Lamanite leaders thought their massive squad meant they could roll over like before; they geared up with shields, breastplates, and thick leather fits to cover their basics, thinking they'd flex hard.
[Alma 49:7] With all that gear, they figured they'd wreck their own bros, either lock them down in chains or straight-up cap them whenever they wanted.
[Alma 49:8] But yo, total plot twist...they got hit with next-level prep no Lehi kid had ever seen, all 'cause Moroni schooled them on how to battle right.
[Alma 49:9] So the Lamanites, aka the Amalickiahites, were mad shook by how next-level the Nephites had leveled up their war game.
[Alma 49:10] If King Amalickiah had rolled up from Nephi leading his army, he probably would've pushed the Lamanites to attack Ammonihah, no cap...he didn't even care about his own squad's blood.
[Alma 49:11] But plot twist: Amalickiah stayed home, and his top generals were too scared to hit Ammonihah 'cause Moroni switched up the game so hard the Lamanites kept getting L'd when trying to find a way in.
[Alma 49:12] So, they dipped into the wilderness, packed up camp, and marched toward Noah's land, thinking that was their next best shot to come at the Nephites.
[Alma 49:13] They had no clue Moroni had already locked down every city around with forts, so they marched on Noah's land full send, with their captains swearing to totally wreck the place.
[Alma 49:14] But no cap, they got majorly shook when they saw that Noah...once a weak spot...had been beefed up by Moroni to flex even harder than Ammonihah.
[Alma 49:15] Moroni was low-key genius...he guessed they'd panic about Ammonihah and hit Noah since it used to be the weakest link, so he flipped the script exactly how he wanted.
[Alma 49:16] Moroni put Lehi in charge as head captain of Noah's men...yep, the same Lehi who threw hands with the Lamanites in that east Sidon River valley showdown.
[Alma 49:17] When the Lamanites saw Lehi was running the city, they got mad bummed 'cause they low-key feared him, but their captains had already sworn to attack, so they rolled up with their armies anyway.
[Alma 49:18] The Lamanites couldn't sneak into the forts except through the main gate 'cause the walls were mad tall and the ditch around was way too deep...no cap, only the entrance was their move.
[Alma 49:19] So the Nephites were fully prepped to frag anyone trying to sneak in other ways...rock drops and arrow rizz on deck, no mercy.
[Alma 49:20] They had their top-tier squad ready at the gate, swords and slings in hand, set to clap anyone trying to breach their safe zone...fully locked in to shut down the Lamanite vibes.
[Alma 49:21] The Lamanite captains rolled up with their armies to the gate and tried to break in, but the Nephites kept sending them back hard, wiping them out with a straight-up massive L.
[Alma 49:22] When the Lamanites couldn't flex through the pass, they tried digging under the walls to make a new route, but got absolutely clapped by stones and arrows; instead of closing the ditches, they low-key filled them with their own dead and injured.
[Alma 49:23] The Nephites had total clout over their foes; Lamanites tried to wreck them till their captains all got ghosted, over a thousand Lamanites downed, while not a single Nephite took the L.
[Alma 49:24] Around fifty got hurt by Lamanite arrows at the pass, but thanks to their shields, breastplates, and helmets, the damage was mostly leg wounds...some pretty brutal, no cap.
[Alma 49:25] Once the Lamanites saw all their top dogs got killed, they dipped into the wilderness, then bounced back to Nephi to spill the tea to King Amalickiah, who was low-key a Nephite by birth, about their epic L.
[Alma 49:26] Amalickiah got mad salty at his crew 'cause he couldn't drape the Nephites in slavery vibes or make them bow down like he wanted.
[Alma 49:27] He was straight-up heated, cursing God and Moroni, swearing he'd sip Moroni's blood...just 'cause Moroni played by God's rules and got his people locked down safe.
[Alma 49:28] Meanwhile, the Nephites were out here thanking God big time for flexing crazy power and snatching them outta enemy hands...no cap, He's unmatched.
[Alma 49:29] And just like that, the 19th year of the judges' rule over the Nephites hit its final chapter.
[Alma 49:30] Peace was nonstop, and the church was booming hard 'cause they actually paid attention and put in work with God's word, dropped by Helaman, Shiblon, Corianton, Ammon, his crew, and all the ordained homies baptized and sent out to preach.
[Alma 50:1] Moroni wasn't about to chill...he kept gearing up for war on the Lamanites, having his armies start year 20 by digging mad earthworks around every Nephite city to lock down defense.
[Alma 50:2] On those dirt ridges, Moroni had timbers stacked up to man-height, building walls all around the cities like a boss.
[Alma 50:3] On top of those timber walls, he had picket frames built all around...solid and tall, no weak sauce.
[Alma 50:4] Moroni built towers peeping over the picket walls with safe spots so Lamanite stones and arrows couldn't touch them...total invincible flex.
[Alma 50:5] From those towers, they were ready to chuck stones hard, taking out anyone dumb enough to come close to the city walls...say less.
[Alma 50:6] So Moroni built mad strongholds around every city, flexing strong defense against any enemy roll-up across the land.
[Alma 50:7] Moroni sent his armies deep into the east wilderness and pushed every Lamanite there straight back to their turf south of Zarahemla...big W energy.
[Alma 50:8] Nephi's land stretched straight from the east sea all the way to the west, no cap, no curves.
[Alma 50:9] After Moroni kicked all the Lamanites out of the east wilderness north of their lands, he moved Zarahemla peeps and neighbors to take over that spot by the shore...claiming the east wilderness for real.
[Alma 50:10] Moroni also posted troops south at the edge of their lands and had them build forts to keep both armies and civilians safe from enemy hands...no cap on security.
[Alma 50:11] Moroni straight-up wiped out Lamanite strongholds east and west, locked down the border from Zarahemla to Nephi along the west sea and river Sidon, with the Nephites holding all the land north...even past Bountiful, no cap.
[Alma 50:12] Moroni's armies kept growing daily, boosted by that protection vibe he built, aiming to snatch the Lamanites' power right off their lands...no power moves for them anymore.
[Alma 50:13] The Nephites kicked off building a city named Moroni by the east sea, right on the southern edge near the Lamanites' turf...strategic flex.
[Alma 50:14] They started building a city foundation between Moroni and Aaron, linking their borders, and named it Nephihah...city collab unlocked.
[Alma 50:15] That same year, they started building a bunch of cities up north, including one named Lehi right by the northern shoreline...big expansion vibes.
[Alma 50:16] And just like that, the twentieth year wrapped up...say less.
[Alma 50:17] So the Nephites kicked off year twenty-one riding high on mad prosperity under the judges' reign...straight-up glow-up season.
[Alma 50:18] They were flexing hard, stacking mad wealth, growing like crazy, and leveling up big-time in the land...no cap.
[Alma 50:19] This shows God's receipts are always legit...merciful and just, fulfilling every promise to mankind, just like He told Lehi back in the day...facts only.
[Alma 50:20] You and your fam get mad blessings if you stick to my rules and flex in the land; but low-key, if y'all dip from my commandments, you get ghosted from God's presence...no receipts, just facts.
[Alma 50:21] The Nephites got receipts on these promises...when they acted sus with fights, murders, plundering, idolatry, cheating, and all kinds of nasty stuff within their squad, it straight-up led to wars and their own downfall.
[Alma 50:22] The faithful clapped back every time, but thousands of their wicked bros got snatched into slavery, caught sword dust, lost their faith, and ended up mixing with the Lamanites...big L energy.
[Alma 50:23] Real talk, there was never a happier vibe among the Nephites since Nephi's era than under Moroni's watch, especially in year twenty-one of the judges' reign...peak main-character energy.
[Alma 50:24] Year twenty-two and twenty-three of the judges' reign both dipped out on a peaceful note...no drama, just chill.
[Alma 50:25] So year twenty-four started peaceful, no cap, but then beef popped off over the land of Lehi and Morianton...both seaside spots right next to each other...and that stir broke the vibe.
[Alma 50:26] The Morianton squad tried to swipe some of Lehi's turf, sparking major beef so heated they pulled up with swords ready to cap their own fam...mad sus moves.
[Alma 50:27] The Lehi crew dipped fast to Moroni's camp, asking for backup since they knew they weren't the ones acting sus.
[Alma 50:28] When Morianton and his crew saw Lehi bounced to Moroni's camp, they got hella scared, low-key shook that Moroni's army would roll through and wreck them.
[Alma 50:29] So Morianton vibes hard, convincing his squad to dip north to the watery lands and snatch up that territory for themselves.
[Alma 50:30] They were about to pull this move, which would've been a straight-up L, but Morianton...hot-headed AF...blew up on one of his maid servants and beat her bad.
[Alma 50:31] She bounced to Moroni's camp, spilled all the tea about Morianton's rage and their plans to ditch northward...major receipts dropped.
[Alma 50:32] Moroni, chillin' in Bountiful, low-key freaked that folks might vibe with Morianton's squad and snatch those lands, starting some serious drama that could straight-up wreck Nephi's freedom.
[Alma 50:33] So Moroni flexed hard, sending his army and camp to block Morianton's crew from ghosting northward...say less, no escape for these clowns.
[Alma 50:34] They didn't stop Morianton's squad till they hit Desolation's border, where Moroni's crew blocked the narrow sea-side pass heading north...ocean on both sides, no cap.
[Alma 50:35] Moroni's army, led by Teancum, clashed with Morianton's stubborn squad hyped by their boss's shady rizz; Teancum straight-up capped Morianton, wrecked his crew, took them L, and bounced back to Moroni's camp...end of year twenty-four, judges still running the show.
[Alma 50:36] So Morianton's squad got brought back, promised to keep chill, and got their land back plus linked up with Lehi's crew...peace vibes restored, no cap.
[Alma 50:37] That same year peace popped off for Nephi, Nephihah, the second chief judge, died...but no cap, he ran the judgment-seat righteous and flawless before God.
[Alma 50:38] Still, Nephihah said nah to Alma claiming the sacred records, so Alma passed the VIP files to his son Helaman...say less, legacy secured.
[Alma 50:39] Peep this: Nephihah's son got the crown as chief judge and governor, swearing an oath to flex justice, keep peace and freedom lit, guard everyone's God-given worship rights, rep God's cause hard, and clap the wicked for their crimes...all day every day.
[Alma 50:40] Meet Pahoran, who took over his dad's spot and started ruling at the end of year twenty-four, running the show for the people of Nephi.
[Alma 51:1] So, kickin' off year twenty-five of the judges' reign over Nephi, peace was locked between Lehi's crew and Morianton's squad over land beef...year started calm, no cap.
[Alma 51:2] But not gonna lie, peace was sus and short-lived 'cause folks started beefin' over chief judge Pahoran...some wanted to tweak parts of the law, low-key stirring the pot.
[Alma 51:3] Pahoran wasn't having it...no way he was gonna change the law or let anyone else do it, so he straight-up ignored the squad dropping petitions to switch things up.
[Alma 51:4] So the law-changers got mad at Pahoran and wanted him out as chief judge, sparking a heated beef...but no cap, it stayed drama, no bloodshed yet.
[Alma 51:5] The squad pushing to yank Pahoran were dubbed king-men since they low-key wanted to flip the free gov script and crown a king instead...major sus move.
[Alma 51:6] Meanwhile, Pahoran's ride-or-die crew called themselves freemen, pledging to keep their rights and worship game strong under a free gov...so the squad split big time.
[Alma 51:7] The beef got settled by straight-up voting, and the people threw their support to the freemen, keeping Pahoran on the throne...big W for freedom squads who shut down the king-men so hard they had no choice but to chill and back liberty.
[Alma 51:8] The king-lovers were mostly born with silver spoons, flexing for the crown, backed by power-hungry peeps craving control over the people...major vibes of elite rizz chasing clout.
[Alma 51:9] But fr, this was a terrible time for Nephi's people to be squabbling since Amalickiah was back at it, hyping up the Lamanites against the Nephites, rounding up soldiers everywhere, gearing up for war hard, swearing he'd drink Moroni's blood...no cap.
[Alma 51:10] Still, his savage promise was mad rash, but he went all in, prepping himself and his armies to throw down against the Nephites.
[Alma 51:11] His army wasn't as huge as before...Nephites had taken down thousands...but Amalickiah still pulled together a massive squad, so he wasn't shook about rolling into Zarahemla.
[Alma 51:12] Yeah, Amalickiah himself led the Lamanites down in year 25 of the judges' reign, just as everyone was finally sorting out the drama over chief judge Pahoran.
[Alma 51:13] When the king-men caught wind the Lamanites were rolling in for war, they low-key got hype inside and straight-up refused to fight, mad salty at the chief judge and freedom squad, so they dipped on defending their own turf.
[Alma 51:14] When Moroni peeped this and saw the Lamanites hitting the land's borders, he got mad AF...like, his soul straight-up boiled from how stubborn those people were after all his grind to keep them safe.
[Alma 51:15] So Moroni sent a petition backed by the people's voice to the governor, asking for the power to force those traitors to defend the country...or else, put them down for real.
[Alma 51:16] His main goal was to kill the drama and beef among the people since that's been the real reason behind all their downfall...and guess what, the people said yes, so it got greenlit.
[Alma 51:17] Moroni ordered his squad to clap back at the king-men, smash their ego and flex, and bring them down or make 'em pick a side...grab weapons and ride for freedom.
[Alma 51:18] The armies rolled up on the king-men, crushed their flex and pride so hard that when they tried to throw hands against Moroni's crew, they got cut down and leveled to dust.
[Alma 51:19] Four thousand of those traitors got clapped by the sword, and the leaders who survived got locked up...no chill for trials right now, time's tight.
[Alma 51:20] The rest of the traitors, instead of getting cut down, caved and repped the liberty flag on their towers and cities, then grabbed weapons to defend their turf.
[Alma 51:21] Moroni straight-up wiped out the king-men label...no more king-men vibes; he crushed their stubborn pride and "noble blood" flex, forcing them to humble up like the rest and fight hard for true freedom.
[Alma 51:22] While Moroni was busy smashing internal beef, bringing peace and order, and gearing up for war, the Lamanites slid into his land right by the seashore borders.
[Alma 51:23] The Nephites were low-key weak in Moroni's city, so Amalickiah rolled through, taking out a ton, then straight-up snatched the city and all the defenses.
[Alma 51:24] The folks who dipped from Moroni's city bounced to Nephihah, while Lehi's crew squad up, gearing up to throw hands at the Lamanites.
[Alma 51:25] But Amalickiah wasn't about to let the Lamanites throw down at Nephihah, so he held them back by the seashore and posted guards in every city to keep defenses tight.
[Alma 51:26] So Amalickiah kept flexing, snagging cities left and right...Nephihah, Lehi, Morianton, Omner, Gid, and Mulek...all those east coast spots by the seashore fell under his control.
[Alma 51:27] Thanks to Amalickiah's slick moves and massive numbers, the Lamanites copped mad cities, all decked out with Moroni-style fortifications, turning each one into a solid Lamanite stronghold.
[Alma 51:28] They pushed all the way to Bountiful's borders, hauling the Nephites like bots and taking out mad people along the way.
[Alma 51:29] But then Teancum showed up, the guy who clapped Morianton and led his crew while they dipped from the scene.
[Alma 51:30] Then Teancum capped Amalickiah too, right as he was moving with his huge squad to snag Bountiful and the lands up north.
[Alma 51:31] But yo, Amalickiah got straight-up clapped...Teancum and his crew were absolute beasts, out-muscling and out-hustling all the Lamanites, totally securing the W.
[Alma 51:32] They kept grinding the Lamanites so hard they were dropping bodies till nightfall; Teancum camped at Bountiful's edge while Amalickiah set up on the beach...straight up stalemate vibes.
[Alma 51:33] When night hit, Teancum and his servant low-key snuck into Amalickiah's camp while everyone was knocked out from the day's grind and heat.
[Alma 51:34] Teancum slid into the king's tent on the DL, jabbed him with a spear straight to the heart, and clapped him instantly...didn't even wake his squad.
[Alma 51:35] Then Teancum ghosted back to his camp, woke up his squad, and spilled all the tea about what he just pulled off.
[Alma 51:36] He put his armies on full alert, no cap, just in case the Lamanites woke up and tried to catch them slippin'.
[Alma 51:37] And that's a wrap on year 25 of the judges ruling Nephi's crew, and yeah, that's the end of Amalickiah's saga.
[Alma 52:1] So, in year 26 of the judges' flex over Nephi's squad, the Lamanites woke up day one, month one, and got hit with the news...Amalickiah was dead in his tent, and Teancum was hyped to throw down that same day.
[Alma 52:2] The Lamanites peeped this and got shook; they bailed on their plan to push north, dipped with their whole squad back to Mulek city, and locked down in their forts for safety.
[Alma 52:3] Amalickiah's bro, Ammoron, got crowned king and took over the throne like, "Say less, I got this," running the show in his brother's place.
[Alma 52:4] Ammoron told his squad to hold tight to the cities they snagged...no cap, every city came with mad bloodshed.
[Alma 52:5] Teancum clocked that the Lamanites were dead set on guarding their blood-bought cities and land, and seeing their massive squad, he low-key decided attacking their forts straight-up wasn't the move.
[Alma 52:6] Still, Teancum kept his crew on standby like they were gearing up for war, building walls and safe spots to flex defense moves against the Lamanites.
[Alma 52:7] He stayed on that war prep grind until Moroni rolled up with a big backup squad to boost his army's clout.
[Alma 52:8] Moroni told him straight: keep every prisoner you catch, no cap, so they could trade 'em back as ransom for their own folks the Lamanites snatched.
[Alma 52:9] Moroni also hit him up to beef up defenses in Bountiful and lock down the narrow pass north, so the Lamanites can't snag that spot and start flexing on them from all sides.
[Alma 52:10] Moroni told him straight up to stay loyal holding that area, hit the Lamanites hard whenever possible, and maybe snatch back those lost cities by any hustle...plus, lock down and pump up the cities still free from Lamanite grip.
[Alma 52:11] Moroni was like, "I'd come through, but the Lamanites are squad-deep near the west sea border, and I'm heading at them, so no can do right now."
[Alma 52:12] King Ammoron dipped from Zarahemla, slid into the queen's DMs about his bro's death, then rounded up a huge squad and headed to throw hands with the Nephites at the west sea border.
[Alma 52:13] Ammoron tried flexing on the Nephites, baiting their forces west, while telling his crews holding the captured cities to mess with the Nephites on the east sea border and snag as much land as their army clout allowed.
[Alma 52:14] So at the end of the 26th year of the judges' reign, the Nephites were caught deep in some serious sus vibes and mad dangerous times.
[Alma 52:15] By year 27 of the judges' flex, Teancum rolled out on Moroni's orders...Moroni had stacked troops holding the south and west borders and was making moves to Bountiful to back Teancum in snatching back lost cities, say less.
[Alma 52:16] Teancum got the green light to go hard on Mulek and snatch it back if the W was in play.
[Alma 52:17] Teancum prepped to clap back at Mulek and take on the Lamanites, but low-key realized their fort was too sus to beat, so he dipped and bounced back to Bountiful to chill and wait for Moroni's backup boost.
[Alma 52:18] Moroni showed up with his squad in Bountiful late in the 27th year of the judges' run over the Nephites, ready to turn the tide.
[Alma 52:19] At the jump of year 28, Moroni, Teancum, and the main captains had a war huddle to cook up plans to bait the Lamanites out or finesse them outta their forts, aiming to snag Mulek back for the W.
[Alma 52:20] They slid into the Lamanite squad at Mulek, hitting up their boss Jacob (a Zoramite) to meet on the plains between cities, but Jacob was straight sus and ghosted the invite, refusing to step out with his army.
[Alma 52:21] Moroni, seeing no shot at a fair fight, cooked up a slick plan to bait the Lamanites outta their forts with some next-level decoy energy.
[Alma 52:22] Moroni had Teancum roll with a small crew near the shore while he and his army ghosted through the west-side wilderness of Mulek at night; next day, Lamanite guards spotted Teancum and dipped to spill the tea to Jacob.
[Alma 52:23] The Lamanite army rolled out to clap back at Teancum, thinking their big numbers would steamroll his small squad, but Teancum peeped the move and started dipping north along the seashore.
[Alma 52:24] When the Lamanites saw Teancum ghosting, they got hyped and chased hard, but while Teancum was basically leading them on a wild goose chase, Moroni ordered part of his squad to slide into the city and claim the W.
[Alma 52:25] They moved in, took out everyone left guarding the city...no cap, they clapped every single one who refused to drop their weapons.
[Alma 52:26] Moroni snatched Mulek with part of his crew while flexin' with the rest to catch the Lamanites when they bounced back from chasing Teancum.
[Alma 52:27] The Lamanites chased Teancum all the way near Bountiful but got snagged by Lehi and his small squad left holding down the city.
[Alma 52:28] The Lamanite leaders saw Lehi and his fresh troops rolling up and totally ghosted in panic, scared they'd lose Mulek to Lehi since they were all drained from the chase.
[Alma 52:29] The Lamanites had no clue Moroni was creeping behind with his army...they were only shook about Lehi and his crew.
[Alma 52:30] Lehi wasn't trying to catch up to the Lamanites early; he wanted to squad up with Moroni's army first.
[Alma 52:31] Before the Lamanites could dip far, Moroni's crew and Lehi's squad boxed them in from both sides...both fresh AF while the Lamanites were dead tired from the long haul.
[Alma 52:32] Moroni told his squad to go hard on the Lamanites until they straight-up dropped their weapons and gave up the fight.
[Alma 52:33] Jacob, the Zoramite boss with unbreakable main-character energy, led the Lamanites charging at Moroni with next-level rage.
[Alma 52:34] Jacob tried slicing through Moroni's path to Mulek, deadass wanting to cap them, but Moroni and his squad were too strong and didn't budge for the Lamanites.
[Alma 52:35] Both sides threw down mad hard, tons got clapped on each squad; Moroni got hurt, but Jacob ended up kaput.
[Alma 52:36] Lehi crushed the Lamanites' backline so hard that those guys dropped their weapons, and the rest got so shook they didn't know where to run or fight next.
[Alma 52:37] Moroni peeped their chaos and was like, "Drop your weapons and we won't be spilling your blood...say less."
[Alma 52:38] When the Lamanite chiefs heard that, the surviving ones stepped up, dropped their weapons at Moroni's feet, and told their squads to do the same...big surrender energy.
[Alma 52:39] Still, a bunch were sus and wouldn't drop their swords, so they got caught, tied up, had their gear snatched, and were forced to squad up with the rest heading into Bountiful.
[Alma 52:40] No cap, more prisoners got caught than the total kills on both teams combined.
[Alma 53:1] They put guards on the Lamanite prisoners and forced them to handle the messy job of burying both their own dead and the Nephites' fallen, while Moroni assigned watchmen to keep tabs on them doing the work.
[Alma 53:2] Moroni rolled up to Mulek with Lehi, took charge, and handed the city over to him; Lehi was Moroni's right-hand dude in most fights, both had mad respect for each other and were loved by all Nephi's crew.
[Alma 53:3] Once the Lamanites finished burying all the dead...both theirs and the Nephites'...they got marched back into Bountiful, where Teancum, on Moroni's orders, had them start digging a ditch all around the city.
[Alma 53:4] He made them stack timber walls on the ditch's inner edge, then threw dirt up against it, forcing the Lamanites to grind until Bountiful was locked down tight with a massive timber and earth wall.
[Alma 53:5] That city turned into a next-level fortress, holding the Lamanite prisoners inside walls they built themselves; Moroni made them work 'cause it was way easier to watch them, prepping his squad for when he planned to strike back.
[Alma 53:6] Moroni scored a major W over one of the Lamanites' biggest armies, grabbed Mulek...their strongest city in Nephi...and flexed by turning it into a fortress to lock down his prisoners.
[Alma 53:7] That year, Moroni dipped from battle mode to flex prepping...building defenses against the Lamanites, securing food for the troops, and hooking up the women and kids to dodge hunger and struggles.
[Alma 53:8] While Moroni was MIA dealing with some Nephite drama causing squad beef, the Lamanite armies on the west sea south low-key took advantage and snatched a few cities from the Nephites.
[Alma 53:9] Straight up, their own toxic vibes...drama and sneaky moves...landed them in the deepest sketchy sitch ever.
[Alma 53:10] So, check it...the people of Ammon started as Lamanites but got flipped by Ammon and his bros, or honestly God's power and word, switched teams to the Lord, moved into Zarahemla, and have been under Nephite protection ever since.
[Alma 53:11] They swore off violence, promising never to spill blood again, so they held back from fighting their own people and would've straight-up perished or got wrecked by their bros if Ammon and his crew hadn't had mad love and mercy for them.
[Alma 53:12] Because of that oath, they got moved to Zarahemla and have been riding under Nephite protection ever since.
[Alma 53:13] When they peeped the danger and all the pain the Nephites were taking for them, they caught mad feels and got hyped to flex and defend their homeland with arms.
[Alma 53:14] Just as they were ready to grab their battle gear, Helaman and his bros hit them with heavy persuasion, reminding them not to break their sacred oath.
[Alma 53:15] Helaman low-key feared that breaking the oath would cost their souls, so everyone who'd sworn kept watch as their bros battled through mad tough times without jumping in.
[Alma 53:16] Peep this: they had hella sons who didn't swear off fightin', so those able-bodied ones rolled up, grabbed their weapons, and repped as Nephites ready to throw hands.
[Alma 53:17] They all swore to flex hard for Nephite freedom, guarding the land even if it meant dropping dead...no cap, they vowed never to lose their liberty and to fight full throttle against any bondage for themselves and the Nephites.
[Alma 53:18] So yeah, 2,000 of these young guys locked in that promise and grabbed their weapons to go all in protecting their homeland.
[Alma 53:19] Since they'd never been a drag on the Nephites before, now they showed up as major support, strapped and ready, asking Helaman to run the show as their leader.
[Alma 53:20] These young bucks flexed mad courage, strength, and energy, but the real tea is...they were 100% legit and trustworthy whenever anyone counted on them.
[Alma 53:21] Deadass, they were men of realness and chill vibes, schooled to stick to God's rules and live straight-up righteous lives.
[Alma 53:22] So Helaman rolled out front, leading his 2,000 stripling soldiers to back up the folks chillin' on the southern borders by the west sea.
[Alma 53:23] And just like that, the 28th year of the judges running the Nephi crew came to a close.
[Alma 54:1] At the jump of year 29 under the judges, Ammoron slid into Moroni's DMs wanting to swap prisoners, say less.
[Alma 54:2] Moroni low-key vibed hard with that offer, 'cause he wanted the supplies feeding the Lamanite captives to fuel his own squad, plus more troops to boost his army's clout.
[Alma 54:3] The Lamanites snatched up tons of women and kids, but Moroni's crew had zero women or kids captive, so he cooked up a slick plan to grab back as many Nephite prisoners from the Lamanites as he could.
[Alma 54:4] So Moroni penned a letter and sent it back with Ammoron's own servant...the same dude who delivered Ammoron's note...with these exact words for Ammoron:
[Alma 54:5] Yo Ammoron, I already hit you up about this beef you started with my people...well, actually your brother kicked it off...and now you're dead set on keeping it going even after he dipped.
[Alma 54:6] Look, I'm here to spill about God's justice and His almighty wrath sword hanging over you...unless you bounce, repent, and pull your troops back to your turf or the land of Nephi you claim.
[Alma 54:7] For real, I'd spill this if you could actually listen: there's some next-level hell waiting for murderers like you and your bro...unless you repent, ditch those savage plans, and take your armies back home.
[Alma 54:8] But since you already ghosted on this truth and flexed against God's people, don't expect you to switch up now ... you'll prolly do the same again.
[Alma 54:9] Heads up, we're ready for you...so unless you quit your plans, you're straight-up inviting God's wrath you've been ignoring, right to your total wipeout.
[Alma 54:10] Deadass, as the Lord lives, our armies are rolling up unless you back out, and death's coming for you quick...we're holding down our cities, lands, and flexing our faith hard for God's cause.
[Alma 54:11] Low-key feels like I'm wasting breath here or you're straight from hell, so I'm wrapping up with this: no prisoner swap unless you hand over a dude, his wife, and kids for one captive...if you're down, then we talk.
[Alma 54:12] Bet, if you don't play ball, I'm bringing my armies...women and kids armed up too...and chasing you back to your own land, our OG inheritance; it's gonna be blood for blood, life for life, and I'll battle you till you're wiped off the map.
[Alma 54:13] Yo, I'm heated, and so is my crew; y'all tried to murder us, but we were just defending. But if you keep trying to wipe us out, we're coming back full force to destroy you...and snag our OG land back, no cap.
[Alma 54:14] Wrapping this letter up: I'm Moroni, running the show as a leader of the Nephites.
[Alma 54:15] So Ammoron got the letter, got mad AF, and fired back with another note to Moroni saying:
[Alma 54:16] I'm Ammoron, king of the Lamanites and bro of Amalickiah, who y'all iced. Bet, I'm coming for revenge with my armies, and your threats? Low-key don't scare me.
[Alma 54:17] Fact check: your ancestors wronged their own fam, snatching government power that was rightfully theirs.
[Alma 54:18] So if y'all drop your weapons and submit to the OG rulers who deserve the crown, I'll get my people to chill and peace out for real.
[Alma 54:19] You've been throwing mad threats at me and my crew, but honestly, we ain't flexing fear at all.
[Alma 54:20] Fine, I'm down to swap prisoners like you asked, no cap...gotta save food for my war squad; and we're signing up for a forever war, either making Nephites submit or wiping them out for good.
[Alma 54:21] And about that God y'all say we ditched? Look, we don't know this dude, and neither do you; but if he's real, maybe he made us both...just saying.
[Alma 54:22] And if there's a devil and hell for real, wouldn't he just send you to join my bro you killed...the same spot you low-key say he landed? But honestly, that's not the main tea here.
[Alma 54:23] I'm Ammoron, straight up descended from Zoram, the dude your ancestors dragged out of Jerusalem.
[Alma 54:24] So yeah, I'm a savage Lamanite; this war's been about revenge and securing what's rightfully ours in government...and that's a wrap on my letter to Moroni.
[Alma 55:1] When Moroni got the letter, he was even more heated, knowing Ammoron was fully clued in on his scam...no cap, Ammoron knew this war wasn't a legit move against the Nephites.
[Alma 55:2] Moroni said: I ain't swapping prisoners with Ammoron unless he drops his plans like I said in my letter; no way I'm letting him gain extra clout beyond what he already has.
[Alma 55:3] I know exactly where the Lamanites are holding my peeps captive; since Ammoron ghosted my letter, I'm gonna hit him back hard...straight up risking death until they beg for peace.
[Alma 55:4] After Moroni dropped those words, he had his squad dig through the ranks to find any dude who traced back to Laman.
[Alma 55:5] They found a guy named Laman...one of the king's servants who got iced by Amalickiah.
[Alma 55:6] Moroni sent Laman and a tight crew to roll up on the guards holding the Nephites.
[Alma 55:7] The Nephites were locked down in Gid, so Moroni picked Laman and a few riders to roll with him.
[Alma 55:8] At night, Laman rolled up to the guards watching the Nephites; they spotted him and called out, but he was like, chill ... I'm Lamanite. We busted out from the Nephites, caught them sleeping, and snagged some wine to flex with.
[Alma 55:9] The Lamanites heard that and low-key hyped him up, saying: Slide us some of that wine, we're beat and glad you came through with the stash.
[Alma 55:10] Laman was like, hold up, save the wine for when we go beast mode on the Nephites...but that just made them crave it more, no cap.
[Alma 55:11] They said, we're beat, so let's sip some wine now; soon we'll get our regular rations that'll juice us up to fight the Nephites.
[Alma 55:12] Laman shrugged and said, do you, go ahead and vibe how you want.
[Alma 55:13] So they chugged the wine with no chill; it hit right, so they kept going harder, 'cause it was straight-up strong AF, made to pack a punch.
[Alma 55:14] They drank up, got lit, and before long, the whole squad was totally smashed.
[Alma 55:15] When Laman and his crew peeped that everyone was wasted and knocked out, they bounced back to Moroni and spilled all the tea.
[Alma 55:16] This was all Moroni's move...he geared up his squad with weapons, slid into Gid while the Lamanites were knocked out drunk, and handed weapons to the prisoners so they could all flex armed.
[Alma 55:17] For real, even the women and kids who could handle a weapon got strapped by Moroni's crew...all done on some stealth ninja-level silence.
[Alma 55:18] If the Lamanites had woken up, they'd still be wasted, so the Nephites could've easily clapped them...no cap.
[Alma 55:19] But nah, Moroni wasn't about that murder vibe...he wasn't hyped on bloodshed; he was all about saving his people, so he kept it 100 and didn't go full savage on the Lamanites while they were wasted.
[Alma 55:20] Still, Moroni got what he came for...he armed the Nephite prisoners inside the city walls and gave them the juice to take control of the inside spots.
[Alma 55:21] Then he told his squad to dip back a bit and circle the Lamanite army, locking them in like a boss.
[Alma 55:22] This all went down at night, so when the Lamanites woke up, they saw they were totally boxed in by Nephites outside and their own prisoners packing heat inside.
[Alma 55:23] So the Lamanites realized the Nephites had them on lock, and low-key knew throwing hands wasn't the move; their top dogs dropped their weapons at the Nephites' feet, begging for mercy.
[Alma 55:24] Just as Moroni planned, he snagged the Lamanites as POWs, claimed the city, freed all the Nephite prisoners, who then joined his squad and boosted his army's clout big time.
[Alma 55:25] Then Moroni made those captured Lamanites start grinding on beefing up the city Gid's walls...no slacking allowed.
[Alma 55:26] After locking down city Gid just how he wanted, Moroni moved his prisoners to Bountiful and put a mad strong squad on guard there too...say less.
[Alma 55:27] Despite all the Lamanites' sus schemes, Moroni's crew kept tight on all their prisoners and held down every inch of the territory they'd snatched back.
[Alma 55:28] The Nephites bounced back hard, stacking W's and taking back their rights and perks, no cap.
[Alma 55:29] The Lamanites kept trying to sneak-encircle them at night, but each time they got clapped and lost mad prisoners...big Ls for them.
[Alma 55:30] They even tried to slip the Nephites some poisoned wine or get them wasted to wipe them out, but it didn't fly.
[Alma 55:31] But fr, the Nephites kept God on their mind during all this mess and didn't fall for the traps...they only sipped the wine after making sure some Lamanite prisoners chugged first.
[Alma 55:32] They played it smart, knowing if the wine was deadly to a Lamanite, it'd def be deadly to a Nephite too...so they tested all the booze before drinking up.
[Alma 55:33] Moroni saw the move and started gearing up to hit Morianton since the Lamanites had been grinding hard to turn that city into a mad fortress.
[Alma 55:34] They kept flexing by rolling fresh troops and stacking supplies nonstop into that city.
[Alma 55:35] And just like that, the 29th year of the judges' reign over the Nephites wrapped up...periodt.
[Alma 56:1] At the jump of year 30's reign of judges, day two, first month, Moroni got a message from Helaman giving the lowdown on what's poppin' in that part of the land.
[Alma 56:2] Helaman wrote, "Yo Moroni, fam in the Lord and in this war grind, I gotta spill some tea about the battles going down in our zone."
[Alma 56:3] Check it, 2,000 sons from the crew Ammon brought outta Nephi...these guys are straight-up descendants of Laman, Lehi's oldest son, in case you forgot.
[Alma 56:4] No cap, I don't gotta run through their sus traditions or lack of faith since you already got the receipts on all that.
[Alma 56:5] So basically, 2,000 of these dudes grabbed their battle gear and wanna vibe with me as their leader, and we're here to flex defense for our turf.
[Alma 56:6] Plus, you know their dads made a promise to never beef with their own bros or spill family blood.
[Alma 56:7] But by year 26, seeing us struggle and grind for them, they were this close to ghosting that promise and picking up arms to back us up.
[Alma 56:8] I wasn't about to let them break their word, betting God's got our back so we wouldn't catch extra L's for keeping their oath tight.
[Alma 56:9] But real talk, here's a W for us: in year 26, I, Helaman, led these 2,000 young guns to Judea city to back up Antipus, your appointed squad boss for that land patch.
[Alma 56:10] I rolled with my 2,000 sons...definitely earned that title...into Antipus's army, and he was hyped since his crew got clapped hard by the Lamanites who took down mad of our guys, so yeah, big sad vibes.
[Alma 56:11] Still, we gotta flex that they died repping their country and God's squad, so low-key, they're vibing happy now.
[Alma 56:12] The Lamanites kept a bunch of prisoners, all big-shot captains...no basic losses spared...and we figure they're chilling in Nephi, unless they've been yeeted by now.
[Alma 56:13] So, these are the cities the Lamanites snagged after clapping so many of our brave soldiers.
[Alma 56:14] The spots taking L's are Manti land, Manti city, Zeezrom city, Cumeni city, and Antiparah city.
[Alma 56:15] When I rolled up to Judea city, the Lamanites already had those cities, and Antipus plus his crew were grinding hard, stacking defenses like pros.
[Alma 56:16] Yeah, they were wiped out physically and mentally...daytime battles, nighttime grind to hold their turf...catching all kinds of major L's and stress.
[Alma 56:17] They were all in to win or die trying, so no cap, my small squad...yeah, my sons...brought mad hype and hope to their vibe.
[Alma 56:18] When the Lamanites peeped Antipus's army got beefed up, Ammoron bossed them to chill and not throw down at Judea or us.
[Alma 56:19] So God came through for us big time...if the Lamanites had attacked while we were weak, they could've totally clapped our small squad, but nah, we got saved.
[Alma 56:20] Ammoron told them to hold onto the cities they snatched, and that wrapped up year 26. By year 27 kickoff, we had our city and squad locked and loaded for defense.
[Alma 56:21] We low-key wanted the Lamanites to come at us instead of us throwing hands in their fortress spots.
[Alma 56:22] So we had eyes everywhere, spying on the Lamanites to catch any sneak attacks on our northern cities, day or night...no sus moves slipping past.
[Alma 56:23] We knew those northern cities were weak sauce against the Lamanites, so we planned to ambush them from behind if they slipped past us...got them squeezed front and back, thinking we'd easily wipe 'em out. But nope, that plan flopped.
[Alma 56:24] The Lamanites were too scared to sneak past with their full squad or even a chunk, 'cause flexing weak could get them clapped.
[Alma 56:25] They didn't have the guts to roll on Zarahemla or cross Sidon's head to hit Nephihah...just straight-up shook.
[Alma 56:26] So yeah, with what they had left, they were dead set on holding onto the cities they already snagged.
[Alma 56:27] Come second month that year, we got mad supplies sent over from the dads of my two thousand sons...major clutch energy.
[Alma 56:28] Plus, 2,000 dudes rolled in from Zarahemla, so we were stacked with 10k soldiers and enough food for them, their wives, and their kiddos.
[Alma 56:29] The Lamanites peeped our squad getting mad beefed up and supplies stacking up daily, so they got scared and started making moves to try cutting off our hookups and power.
[Alma 56:30] Seeing the Lamanites getting all jittery, we cooked up a clutch strat...Antipus told me to roll out with my 'lil sons pretending to deliver supplies to the nearby city, big brain move.
[Alma 56:31] We marched close to Antiparah like we were headed to the city by the seashore on the other side...total fakeout vibes.
[Alma 56:32] So we rolled out, acting like we were hauling supplies to that city...straight-up decoy flex.
[Alma 56:33] Antipus bounced with part of his crew, leaving some to guard the city, but only after I dipped with my small squad and got close to Antiparah...say less.
[Alma 56:34] The city of Antiparah was basically Lamanite HQ, flexing their biggest and thickest army, no cap.
[Alma 56:35] Once their spies spilled the tea, they rolled out with their whole army to come at us...no chill.
[Alma 56:36] We dipped north, low-key running from them, but actually baiting the Lamanites' strongest squad to chase us...big brain moves.
[Alma 56:37] For real, they chased us mad far, and when they spotted Antipus' squad flexing behind, they didn't dip or swerve...just straight-up chased us, probs tryna clap us before Antipus could trap them in our surround.
[Alma 56:38] Antipus saw we were in deep, so he sped up his squad's march, but nightfall hit and neither side caught the other...so we just vibed and camped out for the night.
[Alma 56:39] Before sunrise, the Lamanites were still on our tail, but we weren't strong enough to clap back, and I wasn't about to let my little sons get snatched...so we kept moving, straight into the wilderness.
[Alma 56:40] Neither side dared swerve...Lamanites 'cause they'd get boxed in, me 'cause they'd catch and smash us...so we kept hauling all day deep into the wilderness till dark, no cap.
[Alma 56:41] Morning light hits, and guess what? The Lamanites were right on us again, so we bounced hard, no questions asked.
[Alma 56:42] They didn't chase us far tho, hitting the brakes early on the third day of the seventh month...big sus energy.
[Alma 56:43] No cap, we didn't know if Antipus caught up to them, but I told my squad: watch out, maybe they parked just to bait us into their trap.
[Alma 56:44] So what's the move, my dudes? Y'all ready to throw hands and fight these clowns?
[Alma 56:45] Real talk, Moroni, I've never peeped this much savage energy before...not even with all the Nephites combined.
[Alma 56:46] I always called them my sons 'cause they were mad young, and they hit me back like, 'Father, God's got us, no cap He won't let us drop. We ain't tryna kill our bros, but if they come for us, we gotta move now before they steamroll Antipus' crew.'
[Alma 56:47] These kids never threw hands before but weren't shook by death...valued their dads' freedom way more than their own skins; their moms schooled them: no doubt means God's got the delivery.
[Alma 56:48] They flexed their moms' wisdom to me, straight up saying: no cap, we trust our moms knew what's up.
[Alma 56:49] I rolled back with my two thousand squad after the Lamanites chasing us, and boom, Antipus' armies caught up...things got mad hectic with a savage battle popping off.
[Alma 56:50] Antipus' troops were straight exhausted from the mad fast march and almost got clapped by the Lamanites; if I hadn't pulled up with my two thousand, Lamanites would've won, no cap.
[Alma 56:51] Antipus got iced and a bunch of his top dogs wiped out from that grind-fast march fatigue...so his crew got shook, lost their vibe, and started folding to the Lamanites.
[Alma 56:52] The Lamanites caught a hype boost and chased after them hard, but Helaman rolled up with his two thousand from behind and started wrecking shop so bad that the whole Lamanite squad pulled back and flipped on Helaman.
[Alma 56:53] When Antipus' crew saw the Lamanites switched up and turned around, they clapped back by rallying and hitting the Lamanites' rear hard.
[Alma 56:54] So me, the Nephites, and Antipus' squad circled the Lamanites tight and straight-up smashed them, forcing them to drop their weapons and cuff themselves as POWs.
[Alma 56:55] When the Lamanites threw in the towel, I counted my young warriors, low-key stressing if too many had caught W's (aka got killed).
[Alma 56:56] But yo, biggest W...none of them dropped, fighting like God powered them up; no cap, no one's ever seen that kinda miraculous strength, they clapped the Lamanites so hard the Lamanites got shook and just gave up as POWs.
[Alma 56:57] We had no spot to lock up prisoners safe from Lamanite squads, so we shipped them to Zarahemla, sent some Antipus survivors with 'em, and I linked the rest with my stripling Ammonites for the march back to Judea.
[Alma 57:1] Then I got a letter from King Ammoron saying: if I drop those POWs, he'd hand over Antiparah city to us...big negotiates, no cap.
[Alma 57:2] I hit back the king with a letter, saying we're confident we'd snag Antiparah by force, so handing over POWs for that city would be straight-up dumb; we only trade our prisoners one-for-one, bet.
[Alma 57:3] Ammoron ghosted my offer...no prisoner swap for him...so we started gearing up to straight-up siege Antiparah.
[Alma 57:4] Antiparah's crew dipped out and bounced to their other spots to beef up defenses, so Antiparah city just slid right into our hands.
[Alma 57:5] And that's a wrap on year 28 of the judges' run, no cap.
[Alma 57:6] At the jump of year 29, we got a big supply drop plus 6,000 fresh troops from Zarahemla and nearby, plus 60 Ammonite sons linking up with my OG 2,000 crew...now we're not just strong but stacked with plenty of provisions, say less.
[Alma 57:7] We were low-key hyped to throw down with the army guarding Cumeni city, ready to flex.
[Alma 57:8] Bet, I'ma show you we pulled it off quick; rolling deep or with part of our squad, we circled Cumeni at night just before their snack drop arrived.
[Alma 57:9] We camped all around Cumeni for nights, straight-up sleeping on our swords, pulling all-nighters to guard against Lamanite sneak attacks...which they tried mad times but kept catching L's with spilled blood every time.
[Alma 57:10] Finally, their supply drop showed up and was about to sneak into the city at night, but plot twist...we weren't Lamanites, we were Nephites, so we snatched them and their goods, no cap.
[Alma 57:11] Even after getting ghosted on their supplies, the Lamanites stayed tough on holding Cumeni, so we figured it made sense to send those provisions to Judea and ship our prisoners back to Zarahemla, say less.
[Alma 57:12] Not even days later, the Lamanites straight-up lost all hope for backup and handed Cumeni over to us; mission accomplished, city secured, no cap.
[Alma 57:13] Our prisoners blew up in numbers so much that even with our squad stacked, we had to go all in just to handle them or, low-key, kill some to keep control.
[Alma 57:14] For real, they kept trying to bounce en masse, throwing stones, clubs, anything they could grab, so we ended up taking out over two thousand even after they already surrendered as POWs.
[Alma 57:15] So yeah, we had to either finish them off or watch them sword-ready all the way to Zarahemla, 'cause our food stash barely covered us, even after snagging their supplies, no cap.
[Alma 57:16] In those high-key tense moments, deciding what to do with the POWs was mad serious, but we settled on sending them to Zarahemla, handing some of our crew the job to escort them there, say less.
[Alma 57:17] Next day they bounced back, and we didn't even ask about the prisoners...Lamanites rolled up on us hard, so their squad showed just in time to save us from getting clapped, 'cause Ammoron sent fresh supplies and a big army boost.
[Alma 57:18] The squad we sent with the prisoners pulled up just in time to block the Lamanites, who were about to straight-up overpower us.
[Alma 57:19] But low-key, my squad of 2,060 went full savage, standing tight against the Lamanites and handing out death to anyone who stepped up.
[Alma 57:20] When the rest of our army started to fold against the Lamanites, those 2,060 held it down, hella unshaken and unbothered.
[Alma 57:21] For real, they followed every order on the dot, and things went their way based on their faith...I even remembered how they told me their moms schooled them on that.
[Alma 57:22] Low-key, it was my sons and the crew sent with the prisoners who snagged this huge W, 'cause they straight-up beat the Lamanites back to Manti city.
[Alma 57:23] We held onto Cumeni city, dodged total destruction by the sword, but ngl, we still took some serious L's.
[Alma 57:24] Once the Lamanites dipped, I was like, "Yo, pull my wounded guys from the dead pile ASAP," and got their wounds patched up, no cap.
[Alma 57:25] Outta my 2,060 squad, 200 straight-up passed out from blood loss, but thanks to God's mad mercy, no one flatlined...everyone was hella wounded but alive, making the whole army hype AF.
[Alma 57:26] The squad staying alive was straight-up wild to everyone, especially with a thousand of our bros dead; we low-key credit God's miracle power, 'cause their faith was next-level...believing in a just God who keeps you safe if you don't doubt.
[Alma 57:27] These guys I'm talking about? Young, mentally locked in, always vibing with full trust in God, no cap.
[Alma 57:28] After we patched up our wounded and buried both our dead and the Lamanites' (which was a lot), we hit up Gid to check on those prisoners they were hauling to Zarahemla.
[Alma 57:29] Gid was the main captain flexing boss mode over the crew assigned to watch the prisoners on their way down.
[Alma 57:30] Gid told me straight up: We started hauling the prisoners to Zarahemla and ran into our army's spies who'd been low-key creeping on the Lamanite camp.
[Alma 57:31] They shouted at us like, "Yo, the Lamanite armies are rolling up on Cumeni, and they're gonna crash the city and wreck our squad."
[Alma 57:32] Our prisoners overheard that hype, got mad inspired, and suddenly started rebelling against us...big sus energy.
[Alma 57:33] 'Cause they rebelled, we swung our swords at them; most of their crew charged headfirst into the blades and got rekt, but the leftovers broke through and dipped fast.
[Alma 57:34] Once they bounced and we couldn't catch them, we booked it to Cumeni and rolled up just in time to help our bros hold down the city.
[Alma 57:35] Look, we got saved again from our haters, and mad blessed is God's name...no cap, He's the real MVP pulling these insane saves for us.
[Alma 57:36] When I, Helaman, heard Gid's report, I was hit with mad joy 'cause God kept us alive, no one's completely wiped out, and I trust the fallen squad made it to God's chill afterlife.
[Alma 58:1] Next move was to snag Manti, but flexing with our small squads couldn't pull off leading them out...these guys peeped all our past plays and weren't falling for any bait from their forts.
[Alma 58:2] They outnumbered our army so hard we weren't about to slide up and attack their strongholds...straight-up no cap, that'd be sus.
[Alma 58:3] So, we had to squad up to hold the land we already snatched back, making it smart to wait for backup from Zarahemla along with fresh supplies...say less, patience is the move.
[Alma 58:4] So I sent a rep to the governor to update him on our squad's sitch, then we chilled, waiting on backup and supplies coming straight from Zarahemla.
[Alma 58:5] But low-key, this did barely help ... 'cause the Lamanites kept stacking up strength and supplies daily too, so we were stuck in this stalemate vibe.
[Alma 58:6] The Lamanites kept popping off at us here and there, plotting sneaky moves to mess us up, but we couldn't catch them for a real fight 'cause they kept ghosting back to their forts...big evasive flex.
[Alma 58:7] We stayed stuck in that rough grind for months on end, almost running outta food and about to tap out.
[Alma 58:8] Then we finally got food, escorted by a 2,000-man squad rolling up to back us; that's the only backup we scored to hold down our turf against an enemy squad so massive they're basically infinite.
[Alma 58:9] We had no clue why more backup wasn't sliding through, and low-key that had us shook and stressed, scared God's wrath might roll up and wreck our whole land.
[Alma 58:10] So we went all in with prayer, begging God to boost our strength, rescue us from enemies' grip, and help us keep our cities, lands, and stuff to hold down our people's vibe.
[Alma 58:11] For real, the Lord showed up with big vibes, promising to save us; He calmed our souls, dropped mad faith on us, and got us hyped to trust He'd break us out.
[Alma 58:12] With our tiny squad, we got mad courage, locked in to clap our enemies, lock down our lands, possessions, wives, kids, and keep that freedom vibe alive.
[Alma 58:13] So, we rolled up full send against the Lamanites chillin' in Manti, setting up camp just outside the city by the wild side, ready to flex hard.
[Alma 58:14] Next day, the Lamanites caught us camped near the city's edge, so they sent spies on a full recon mission to cop the size and power of our crew.
[Alma 58:15] When they peeped we weren't as strong as our numbers said, scared we'd block their supply lines if they didn't step up and fight...and thinking their huge army could easily roast us...they started gearing up to throw down.
[Alma 58:16] Seeing them prepping to attack, I low-key sent Gid and a few soldiers to hide out in the wilderness, same with Teomner and his small squad, lying low and ready to strike.
[Alma 58:17] Gid and his crew hid right side, Teomner's on the left; once they dipped undercover, I stayed put with the rest of the troops where we first camped, waiting for the Lamanites to ghost out for battle.
[Alma 58:18] The Lamanites rolled up with their massive army ready to slash, but I told my squad to bounce into the wilderness before they could swing.
[Alma 58:19] The Lamanites chased us fast, mad eager to cap us, so they dove into the wilderness, but we slid right between Gid and Teomner's squads without the Lamanites clocking a thing.
[Alma 58:20] After the Lamanite army dipped past, Gid and Teomner jumped outta hiding and snatched the Lamanite spies, making sure they couldn't ghost back to the city.
[Alma 58:21] After clipping those spies, they sprinted to the city, wrecked the guards left on watch, and straight up took over the whole city...big L for the Lamanites.
[Alma 58:22] This went down 'cause the Lamanites flexed their whole army into the wilderness, leaving just a few guards holding the fort.
[Alma 58:23] So Gid and Teomner snagged control of their strongholds, and after grinding through the wilderness, we headed straight for Zarahemla.
[Alma 58:24] When the Lamanites caught us heading for Zarahemla, they got mad shook, thinking we were setting them up for a major L, so they dipped back into the wilderness, ghosting the same way they came.
[Alma 58:25] Night fell, so they pitched tents, 'cause the Lamanite bosses thought the Nephites were beat from marching and figured they'd chased their whole army off...so they totally slept on defending Manti.
[Alma 58:26] When night hit, I made my squad skip sleep and sneak-march another route straight toward Manti...say less.
[Alma 58:27] Thanks to our night grind, next day we flexed past the Lamanites and pulled up at Manti before they could even catch the vibe.
[Alma 58:28] So yeah, we copped Manti smooth AF with this move...no blood, no drama, just straight-up W's.
[Alma 58:29] When the Lamanite horde rolled up to the city and peeped our ready flex, they got mad shook and dipped back into the wilderness like total scared cats.
[Alma 58:30] Yeah, the Lamanite armies bailed from this whole area, but heads up...they dragged a bunch of women and kids with them on the low.
[Alma 58:31] All the cities the Lamanites snatched are now back in our hands, and our fam...fathers, moms, kids...are heading home, except for the ones the Lamanites snatched and dragged off as prisoners.
[Alma 58:32] Real talk, our squads are low-key too small to hold down all these cities and the massive turf we just scored.
[Alma 58:33] But fr, we're vibin' on God who handed us the W over those lands, so we snagged back what's rightfully ours...cities and all.
[Alma 58:34] Low-key, no one knows why the government hasn't hooked us up with more muscle, not even the guys who rolled up to back us.
[Alma 58:35] Honestly, maybe y'all struck out and pulled the troops that way; if that's the case, we're not here for any whining.
[Alma 58:36] But if that's not it, we're low-key worried some squad in the government's playing sus and holding back reinforcements, 'cause we know they got way more troops than what they sent us.
[Alma 58:37] Still, no cap, it don't even matter... we trust God's got our back and will pull us outta enemy clutches, even with our weak squads.
[Alma 58:38] Yo, it's year 29 wrapping up, we still holding down our lands, and the Lamanites just bounced back to the land of Nephi.
[Alma 58:39] The sons of Ammon I hyped up? They're chillin' with me in Manti, and God's been their shield...no cap, not a single soul got sniped by the sword.
[Alma 58:40] Yeah, they got mad wounds, but they're holding tight to the freedom God blessed them with, staying woke to God daily, keeping His rules 24/7, and their faith is hella strong on those future prophecies.
[Alma 58:41] Yo, Moroni, my bro, may God...who set us free and saved us...keep you tight in His presence, and bless our peeps so you can snatch back everything the Lamanites jacked that's ours for survival. Alright, I'm Helaman, Alma's son, signing off.
[Alma 59:1] So, in year 30 of the judges runnin' Nephi, Moroni got Helaman's letter and got hyped AF about how Helaman crushed it getting back those lost lands.
[Alma 59:2] He flexed the news to everyone nearby so they could catch the hype and celebrate too.
[Alma 59:3] Quick, he slid into Pahoran's inbox asking him to squad up and beef up Helaman's army so holding that lit land would be a breeze.
[Alma 59:4] After Moroni dropped that letter to Zarahemla, he started scheming to snag back the rest of the lands and cities the Lamanites clutched.
[Alma 59:5] While Moroni was gearing up to throw hands with the Lamanites, the folks from Nephihah...repping Moroni, Lehi, and Morianton...got ambushed by those same Lamanites.
[Alma 59:6] Even the peeps forced to dip from Manti and nearby spots rolled up and teamed with the Lamanites in this area.
[Alma 59:7] Lowkey stacking up daily, these mad numbers, hyped by Ammoron's orders, rolled on Nephihah and started wrecking them hard, slaughter on another level.
[Alma 59:8] Their armies were mad huge, so the rest of Nephihah had to bounce, and they slid right into Moroni's squad.
[Alma 59:9] Moroni figured they'd send backup to Nephihah 'cause holding the city is way easier than reclaiming it, so he was low-key confident they'd keep it locked down.
[Alma 59:10] So Moroni kept his whole crew tight, focused on holding down the spots they already clapped back.
[Alma 59:11] When Moroni peeped Nephihah got snatched, he got mad sad and started doubting if, cuz of the people's sus wickedness, his own crew might end up catching L's from their own kin.
[Alma 59:12] Same vibe with all his top captains...they were shook and low-key shook over the people's bad behavior, especially since the Lamanites kept flexing on them.
[Alma 59:13] Moroni was straight-up heated at the gov for being hella chill about their country's freedom getting messed with.
[Alma 60:1] So Moroni slid into the governor Pahoran's inbox again with a letter like, "Yo Pahoran, big boss judge in Zarahemla, and all the squad picked to run this war...listen up."
[Alma 60:2] Heads up, I gotta throw some shade your way...y'all were supposed to rally troops, hook them up with swords, scimitars, and all the war gear, then send them grinding on the Lamanites wherever they popped up in our turf.
[Alma 60:3] Real talk, me, my squad, and Helaman's crew have been through mad struggles...starving, thirsty, tired AF, and dealing with every type of pain imaginable.
[Alma 60:4] For real, if that was all, we'd stay chill and not throw shade or complain.
[Alma 60:5] But nah, tons of our people got straight-up bodied, thousands fallen by the sword, all 'cause y'all slept on sending our armies the backup and power they needed...your neglect big time, no cap.
[Alma 60:6] So like, we wanna know why y'all straight-up ignored us like that; what's up with your clueless vibes?
[Alma 60:7] For real, you just gonna vibe on your throne, brain on airplane mode, while enemies out here dropping mad bodies and killing thousands of your own fam?
[Alma 60:8] Even those who banked on you for backup put you in the driver's seat to help, send armies, boost their squad, and save thousands from catching those L's by the sword.
[Alma 60:9] And it gets worse...you straight-up locked up supplies, so many fought and bled out chasing that W for the people, even while starving 'cause y'all ghosted them hardcore.
[Alma 60:10] Yo, my brothers...you should be loved and for real be grinding harder for the people's freedom, but nah, you neglected them so bad that thousands' blood is on your hands, and God's got all the receipts on their cries and pain.
[Alma 60:11] For real, y'all think you can just chill on your thrones, banking on God's kindness to bail you out while you do jack? Nah, if that's your vibe, you've been straight-up fooled.
[Alma 60:12] You really think all your homies getting killed means they were bad? Nah, if that's your take, you're dead wrong; lots died by the sword, and low-key, that's on you.
[Alma 60:13] God lets the righteous get taken out so His justice can clap back on the wicked; so don't think the good ones are lost when they die...they're just chilling in God's rest now.
[Alma 60:14] Real talk, I'm mad worried God's judgments are about to drop on these folks 'cause their government's mad lazy, straight-up neglecting their own brothers, even those who got clipped.
[Alma 60:15] If it wasn't for the mess starting right at the top, we'd have held strong and kept our enemies from gaining any clout over us.
[Alma 60:16] If we hadn't started beefing internally and those power-hungry king-men hadn't flexed on us, messing everything up, we could've squad-ed up, crushed our enemies with God's strength, and made moves like He promised.
[Alma 60:17] Now the Lamanites are rolling up, snatching our lands, slaying our people...including women and kids...and dragging them into captivity, making them suffer hard...all 'cause those power-hungry king-men were flexing wickedly.
[Alma 60:18] But fr, why say more? We low-key don't even know if y'all aren't also hunting for power and maybe even playing traitor to your own crew.
[Alma 60:19] Or are you just chillin' in the safest spot, ignoring us, not sending food or backup to boost our troops? That's sus.
[Alma 60:20] Did y'all just ghost on God's commands? Forgot how our parents got snapped outta captivity? Or all the times we bounced back from our enemies? Say less, that's wild forgetfulness.
[Alma 60:21] You really think God's gonna save us if we just chill on our thrones, ignoring all the tools He handed us? Big nope.
[Alma 60:22] For real, you gonna stay lazy while you're surrounded by thousands just vibing the same, and meanwhile folks at the borders are getting cut down, bleeding out? Bet that's a hard L.
[Alma 60:23] You think God's gonna swipe right on you for sitting back while this mess goes down? Nah, fam. Remember, God says clean your soul first before flexing on the outside.
[Alma 60:24] Unless y'all repent, get off your lazy asses, and send food plus troops to us and Helaman to hold the ground he got, and help us reclaim the rest, it's best we pause beefin' with the Lamanites till we clean up the top of our government first.
[Alma 60:25] Unless you vibe with my letter, flex real freedom energy, boost our armies, and hook them up with food, I'll leave some of my freemen holding down this land, powered up by God's blessings so no enemy can touch them.
[Alma 60:26] That's all 'cause of their mad faith and chill patience through all the trials.
[Alma 60:27] I'll roll up to y'all, and if anyone's still vibing with freedom...even just a tiny spark...I'll light up rebellions so fierce that all the power-grabbing snakes get totally wiped out.
[Alma 60:28] Fact: I ain't scared of your flex or clout, but I do respect my God. So, obeying His commands, I grab my sword to protect my country, and honestly, y'all's bad moves caused all this pain.
[Alma 60:29] Yo, the clock's ticking...if you don't step up to protect your land and your fam, justice's sword is gonna drop on you hard, and it won't be pretty, straight up total destruction.
[Alma 60:30] I'm low-key waiting on backup from y'all; if you don't send help, I'll roll up to Zarahemla and smack you down so hard with the sword that you won't block our freedom grind no more.
[Alma 60:31] No cap, God won't let y'all get strong in your mess and wreck His righteous crew.
[Alma 60:32] For real, do you think God will cut you slack and judge the Lamanites instead? Nah, their hate's an old family drama, just amped up by our traitors, while you're just caught up chasing clout and flexing on the wrong stuff.
[Alma 60:33] You know you're breaking God's laws and straight-up stomping on them. God told me: if your leaders don't repent, you're gonna have to throw hands against your own.
[Alma 60:34] Look, I, Moroni, gotta keep my promise to God, so y'all better stick to His word and fast-track those supplies and troops to me and Helaman, no cap.
[Alma 60:35] If you don't send help, I'm coming quick; God won't let us starve, so if we gotta take your food by force, bet we will. You better deliver on God's word.
[Alma 60:36] I'm Moroni, your main captain...here to smash power, not chase it; I'm all about God's rep and my country's freedom, not clout. Fin.
[Alma 61:1] So right after Moroni sent his letter to the top governor, he got one back from Pahoran, the big boss himself. Here's what Pahoran said:
[Alma 61:2] I, Pahoran, the head honcho here, hit up Moroni, army chief, saying: Moroni, I ain't vibing with your struggles...fr, it hits me hard.
[Alma 61:3] But real talk, some peeps are low-key hyped on your pain...so much they straight rebelled against me, even free folks from my crew, and trust me, their squad's mad big.
[Alma 61:4] The ones trying to snatch my judge seat caused this whole mess; they played mad flattery and swayed tons of people's hearts, leading to major pain for us; they're holding back supplies and scaring our free folks so they don't roll through to you.
[Alma 61:5] They straight-up kicked me out, so I dipped to Gideon with as many soldiers as I could round up.
[Alma 61:6] I dropped a broadcast all over this area, and peeps are pulling up daily, ready to flex for their country, freedom, and to clap back at the haters.
[Alma 61:7] So many have joined us that the rebels are shook, totally scared to step up and throw hands with us.
[Alma 61:8] They snatched Zarahemla and crowned a king who hit up the Lamanite king to squad up; their plan's to hold Zarahemla as a launchpad so Lamanites can takeover the rest, with this dude flexing as king after they win.
[Alma 61:9] You clapped back at me in your letter, but I'm chill, actually hyped by your big heart. I, Pahoran, ain't chasing power...just wanna keep my judge seat to guard our rights and freedom. My soul's solid in the liberty God gave us, no cap.
[Alma 61:10] So here's the tea...we're ready to fight dirty if we gotta, but we ain't about spilling Lamanite blood if they just chill in their own zone.
[Alma 61:11] We wouldn't go savage on our own fam if they didn't start beef and come at us with swords first.
[Alma 61:12] We'd low-key accept being slaves if God's justice demanded it or if He straight-up told us to roll with that.
[Alma 61:13] But nah, He ain't telling us to fold to our enemies; He wants us to trust Him, and He'll pull through for us.
[Alma 61:14] So, bro Moroni, let's clap back at evil; if words don't cut...like rebellions and drama...let's flex swords to keep our freedom and vibe with the blessings of our church and Redeemer.
[Alma 61:15] So bounce to me ASAP with some of your squad, leave the rest with Lehi and Teancum, and give them the juice to run the war there, powered by God's Spirit...the same vibe that fuels their freedom hustle.
[Alma 61:16] Heads up, I sent some supplies their way so they don't ghost before you roll up to me.
[Alma 61:17] Squad up all the muscle you can on your way here, and we'll blitz those traitors fast, powered by God and our unshakeable faith.
[Alma 61:18] We're grabbing Zarahemla to score more food for Lehi and Teancum; rolling out with the Lord's power to shut down this major sus rebellion.
[Alma 61:19] Moroni, low-key glad I got your letter 'cause I was kinda stressing about whether clapping back at our own was even the move.
[Alma 61:20] But you said, if they don't bounce back from their ways, the Lord's ordering you to go hard on them.
[Alma 61:21] Make sure Lehi and Teancum level up their faith; tell them don't stress, God's got their backs and everyone holding tight to the freedom He gave. Signing off this letter to my day one, Moroni.
[Alma 62:1] When Moroni got the letter, his heart flexed mad courage and pure hype 'cause Pahoran was loyal AF to freedom and their country's grind, no cap.
[Alma 62:2] Still, Moroni was mad bummed about the fools who booted Pahoran from power...straight-up betraying their country and God, major L vibes.
[Alma 62:3] So Moroni rolled with a small crew like Pahoran asked, handed Lehi and Teancum the rest of the army's reins, and dipped towards Gideon's turf.
[Alma 62:4] Everywhere Moroni dropped in, he hoisted the flag of liberty and flexed every recruit he could rally on his way to Gideon's zone.
[Alma 62:5] Thousands swiped right on Moroni's cause, grabbing swords to flex for their freedom and dodge getting locked in chains.
[Alma 62:6] Moroni stacked his crew as he rolled to Gideon, linked up with Pahoran's squad, and together they got mad strong...way stronger than Pachus and his rebels who kicked the freemen from Zarahemla and stole the land.
[Alma 62:7] Moroni and Pahoran rolled deep with their armies into Zarahemla, pulled up on the city, and clashed with Pachus's crew till it popped off.
[Alma 62:8] Pachus got clipped, his squad caught cap, and Pahoran slid back into his judgment-seat like the king he was meant to be.
[Alma 62:9] Pachus's crew and the king-men caught the legal dragnet; if they skipped defending their country and went against it, they got the death sentence...law's law, no cap.
[Alma 62:10] So yeah, they had to keep that law tight to keep their country safe; anyone side-eyeing their freedom got dealt with asap, no exceptions.
[Alma 62:11] That wraps up year 30 of the judges' run over Nephi ... Moroni and Pahoran brought peace back to Zarahemla, and anyone betraying freedom got that final clapback.
[Alma 62:12] At the start of year 31, Moroni flexed hard...sent supplies plus 6,000 troops to back Helaman holding down that corner of the land, say less.
[Alma 62:13] Moroni also sent 6,000 soldiers loaded with enough chow to squad up Lehi and Teancum's armies, all to keep the Lamanites from flexing on the land.
[Alma 62:14] Moroni and Pahoran left a big crew holding Zarahemla, then bounced with a heavy squad to Nephihah, dead set on dunking on the Lamanites in that city.
[Alma 62:15] While marching, they caught a big Lamanite squad slipping, clapped mad of them, and snagged their food and war gear...big L W energy.
[Alma 62:16] After the takedown, they made those Lamanites swear on a covenant...no more beef or beefing with the Nephites, promised to chill for real.
[Alma 62:17] After sealing that covenant, they shipped like 4,000 surviving Lamanites to kick it with the people of Ammon, turning the whole vibe around.
[Alma 62:18] Once they sent those homies off, they kept rolling toward Nephihah, and when they hit the city, they set up camp lowkey in the plains just outside the spot.
[Alma 62:19] Moroni was hyped to get the Lamanites to throw hands on the plains, but those Lamanites saw the squad's mad courage and numbers and got too sus to face them, so no battle that day, period.
[Alma 62:20] When night fell, Moroni lowkey slid out and scoped the city walls in the dark to peep where the Lamanite army was camping.
[Alma 62:21] Turns out, the Lamanites were crashin' on the east side by the entrance, dead asleep; so Moroni bounced back, told his crew to hustle up strong ropes and ladders to slide down the wall's inside.
[Alma 62:22] Moroni had his squad climb the wall and sneak down on the west side where the Lamanites weren't camping...big stealth move, no cap.
[Alma 62:23] They all slid into the city under cover of night using ropes and ladders, so by morning, the entire crew was flexing inside the city walls, no cap.
[Alma 62:24] When the Lamanites woke up and saw Moroni's squad chilling inside the walls, they freaked hard and dipped out through the pass, no lie.
[Alma 62:25] Seeing the Lamanites ghosting, Moroni had his crew chase down the runaways, took out a bunch, trapped a ton, and the rest bounced all the way to Moroni's turf by the seashore...major W.
[Alma 62:26] Moroni and Pahoran snagged Nephihah city without losing a single homie, while a bunch of Lamanites got wrecked...straight L to them.
[Alma 62:27] A whole crew of Lamanite prisoners caught feelings for the people of Ammon and wanted to switch sides to live that free life, say less.
[Alma 62:28] Whoever wanted in got the green light...straight up, their wish was the command, no cap.
[Alma 62:29] So all the Lamanite prisoners joined the Ammonites and started grinding hard...planting crops, raising animals...basically lifting mad weight off the Nephites, who were finally free from handling those prisoners.
[Alma 62:30] After Moroni snagged Nephihah, scooped up tons of prisoners to seriously shrink the Lamanite army, and freed a bunch of Nephite captives to boost his own squad, he bounced from Nephihah to Lehi like a boss.
[Alma 62:31] When the Lamanites caught wind that Moroni was rolling up, they got shook again and straight-up dipped from his army, no cap.
[Alma 62:32] Moroni and his squad chased the Lamanites city to city until Lehi and Teancum showed up, making the Lamanites bail all the way down to Moroni's turf by the seashore...full-on ghost mode.
[Alma 62:33] The whole Lamanite army pulled up together in Moroni's land, packed tight like one squad, with Ammoron, their king, right there leading the vibes.
[Alma 62:34] Moroni, Lehi, and Teancum set up camp with their armies surrounding the edges of Moroni's land, trapping the Lamanites with wilderness blocking their south and east exits...total lockdown.
[Alma 62:35] They all crashed for the night...Nephites and Lamanites mad tired from the long march...so no one was plotting moves except Teancum, who was straight-up heated at Ammoron and his bro Amalickiah for dragging everyone into this endless war, spilling blood and causing major famine vibes.
[Alma 62:36] Mad with rage, Teancum sneaked into the Lamanite camp, slid down the city walls, hunted down the king, and threw a javelin that hit him close to the heart...but the king woke his crew before dying, and they chased down and killed Teancum.
[Alma 62:37] When Lehi and Moroni got the news that Teancum was dead, they hit peak sadness... dude was a ride-or-die hero for freedom who'd been through hell and back, but now he'd joined the whole "dead" squad like the rest of us.
[Alma 62:38] Next day, Moroni rolled up on the Lamanites and totally bodied them, causing a massive L... they got pushed out and bounced so hard they didn't even try to come back at the Nephites for now.
[Alma 62:39] So the 31st year of the judges' rule over Nephi wrapped up, packed with nonstop wars, bloodshed, famine, and mad suffering for like, way too long.
[Alma 62:40] The Nephites were caught up in murders, beefs, and all kinds of shady moves, but low-key, thanks to the righteous crew's prayers, they got spared from total wipeout.
[Alma 62:41] Real talk, the war dragged on so long it made some people straight-up callous, but others got hit so hard by the pain they humbled themselves deep before God, no cap.
[Alma 62:42] After Moroni beefed up the weak spots to block the Lamanites, he bounced back to Zarahemla, Helaman rolled back to his inherited spot, and peace was finally back on the Nephites' block.
[Alma 62:43] Moroni handed the army reins to his son Moronihah, then dipped to his crib to chill out and vibe with peace for the rest of his days.
[Alma 62:44] Pahoran got back on his judgment throne, and Helaman picked up preaching God's word again, 'cause with all the wars and beefs, the church needed to get its act together ASAP.
[Alma 62:45] So Helaman and his bros rolled out, dropping God's word with mad power, convincing a ton of folks about their bad vibes, making them repent and get baptized into the Lord's squad.
[Alma 62:46] They straight-up re-launched God's church all over the land, putting it back on the map.
[Alma 62:47] For real, they set up rules for the law and picked their judges and top judges to keep things tight.
[Alma 62:48] The Nephites started flexing big time again...multiplying, getting mad strong, and stacking serious wealth in their turf.
[Alma 62:49] Even with all the riches, power, and glow-up, they kept it humble, no full ego flex, always remembering the Lord and staying mad humble before Him.
[Alma 62:50] They kept receipts of all the epic moves the Lord pulled...saving them from death, chains, prisons, every struggle, and snatching them from their enemies' grip.
[Alma 62:51] They prayed to the Lord nonstop, and He came through with blessings like promised, making them glow up strong and prosper hard in their land.
[Alma 62:52] So yeah, all that went down, and Helaman clocked out in year thirty-five of the judges' reign over the Nephites.
[Alma 63:1] At the jump of year thirty-six under the judges, Shiblon grabbed the sacred stuff Alma passed to Helaman...say less.
[Alma 63:2] Shiblon was straight-up righteous, walking clean before God, grinding good deeds nonstop, keeping the Lord's commands tight...same vibes with his brother.
[Alma 63:3] Then Moroni dipped too, wrapping up year thirty-six of the judges' reign...end of an era, no cap.
[Alma 63:4] Year thirty-seven, squad of 5,400 men plus their wifeys and kids dipped from Zarahemla heading way north...big move energy.
[Alma 63:5] Hagoth, low-key mad curious, built a massive ship on Bountiful's edge near Desolation and launched that beast into the west sea through the narrow neck toward the north land.
[Alma 63:6] Tons of Nephites hopped on Hagoth's ship, stocked up, brought women and kids, and set sail north...year thirty-seven closed out with that move, say less.
[Alma 63:7] Year thirty-eight, Hagoth built more ships; the OG ship came back, scooped up more people and supplies, then bounced north again...big expansion energy.
[Alma 63:8] After that, radio silence on them...probably got wrecked in the deep sea, no cap. Another ship dipped too, but where it landed? Total mystery, no receipts.
[Alma 63:9] So, that year, a bunch more peeps dipped north, closing out year thirty-eight with major migration vibes.
[Alma 63:10] In year thirty-nine, Shiblon clocked out, and Corianton bounced north by ship, hauling supplies to the homies who dipped there.
[Alma 63:11] So, before Shiblon died, he passed the sacred stuff to Helaman Jr., named after his dad...keeping it in the fam, no cap.
[Alma 63:12] Peep this, all the engravings Helaman had got copied and spread among the people everywhere...except the parts Alma said to keep on the low.
[Alma 63:13] Still, these sacred vibes were meant to be passed down generation to generation...so this year, Helaman got them before Shiblon clocked out.
[Alma 63:14] Also that year, some dissenters dipped to the Lamanites and hyped them back up mad salty against the Nephites...big sus energy.
[Alma 63:15] That year, they rolled up with a huge army trying to clap Moronihah's squad, but Moronihah's crew bodied them and sent 'em packing with mad L's.
[Alma 63:16] And just like that, year thirty-nine of the judges' reign over the Nephites came to a close...vibe check complete.
[Alma 63:17] That's a wrap on the story of Alma, his son Helaman, and Shiblon, the other son...legacy secured, say less.
[Helaman 1:1] So, kicking off year forty of the judges' reign, the Nephites started catching some serious drama...big sus moving in the squad.
[Helaman 1:2] Pahoran died, taking that final exit, so major beef popped off over which of his sons deserved the judgment throne...family drama on max.
[Helaman 1:3] The main players beefing for the judgment-seat...and stirring the crowd...were Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni...three-way rizz battle, no cap.
[Helaman 1:4] Not all Pahoran's sons, since he had a squad, but these three went full clout chase for the judgment-seat, splitting the people into three messy squads.
[Helaman 1:5] But at the end of the day, the people's vote crowned Pahoran chief judge and governor over the Nephites...main character energy secured.
[Helaman 1:6] When Pacumeni saw the judgment-seat was outta reach, he just vibed with the people's choice instead...know when to play the game, bet.
[Helaman 1:7] But Paanchi and his hype squad got mad salty, tryna flex and hype a rebellion against their own crew...major sus moves brewing.
[Helaman 1:8] Just as Paanchi was about to spark that rebellion, he got caught, put on trial by the people, and sentenced to death...no cap, he was out here trying to wreck everyone's freedom.
[Helaman 1:9] When Paanchi's crew found out he got the death sentence, they lost their cool and sent Kishkumen to straight-up assassinate Pahoran right on the judgment-seat...that's next-level beef, no cap.
[Helaman 1:10] Pahoran's crew chased Kishkumen hard, but dude was ghost mode activated...too fast for anyone to catch, like he hit warp speed.
[Helaman 1:11] Kishkumen rolled back to his squad, and they all made a serious pact, swearing on the OG Creator to keep Pahoran's murder on the DL...no receipts leaked.
[Helaman 1:12] Kishkumen pulled off the hit incognito, so no one knew he was the perp; he and his crew blended in low-key, but anyone caught got the death sentence...no hiding from the receipts.
[Helaman 1:13] So Pacumeni got the crown as chief judge and governor, legit by the people's vote and his right, stepping up after Pahoran; this all went down in year forty of the judges' reign...game over for that chapter.
[Helaman 1:14] Year forty-one of the judges' reign, the Lamanites pulled up with an army too big to count, loaded with swords, scimitars, bows, arrows, head-plates, breastplates, and every shield you can flex.
[Helaman 1:15] They rolled back up to throw hands with the Nephites, led by Coriantumr...a Zarahemla descendant turned rebel Nephite...big dude with mad power energy.
[Helaman 1:16] Tubaloth, Lamanite king and son of Ammoron, thought Coriantumr's mad strength and brainpower would let him flex hard and dominate the Nephites if he led the charge...big bets on that dude.
[Helaman 1:17] So Tubaloth hyped the squad mad, flexed his armies, put Coriantumr in charge, and sent them marching down to Zarahemla to throw down with the Nephites.
[Helaman 1:18] With all the drama and chaos in government, Zarahemla was low-key undefended since folks thought the Lamanites wouldn't dare invade the city's core...big miscalculation, no cap.
[Helaman 1:19] Coriantumr led his massive crew on a mad fast march, catching the city's people off guard so quick the Nephites didn't even have time to squad up for battle.
[Helaman 1:20] Coriantumr took out the gate guards, rolled his whole army into the city, and wiped out anyone who tried to flex back, securing total takeover no cap.
[Helaman 1:21] Pacumeni, the chief judge, dipped to the city walls trying to escape Coriantumr, but Coriantumr clocked him so hard against the wall that Pacumeni died...end of his run, no cap.
[Helaman 1:22] When Coriantumr saw he owned Zarahemla, and the Nephites were ghosting, getting roasted, copped, and locked up, he got mad hyped and was ready to flex on the whole land.
[Helaman 1:23] Coriantumr didn't chill in Zarahemla; he bounced with a massive squad toward Bountiful, dead set on slicing through with his sword to snag the northern lands.
[Helaman 1:24] Thinking their main flex was in the land's center, he moved so fast they could only squad up in small groups, then he rolled through and wiped them out hardcore.
[Helaman 1:25] But low-key, Coriantumr's fast march through the center gave Moronihah a dope advantage, even though the Nephites took some major L's in numbers.
[Helaman 1:26] Moronihah was banking that the Lamanites wouldn't flex into the land's center, expecting their usual border city attacks, so he had squads guarding the edges tight.
[Helaman 1:27] But nah, the Lamanites weren't scared like Moronihah hoped...they rolled right into the land's center, snatched Zarahemla, and swept through key spots, dunking on men, women, and kids alike, grabbing mad cities and strongholds.
[Helaman 1:28] Once Moronihah caught the tea, he bounced Lehi out with an army to intercept the Lamanites before they hit Bountiful...say less.
[Helaman 1:29] Facts, Lehi pulled up and blocked them before Bountiful, dropped battle so hard the Lamanites started ghosting back to Zarahemla.
[Helaman 1:30] Moronihah chased their retreat, threw down in a savage battle, blood everywhere, with tons falling...including Coriantumr himself catching those L's.
[Helaman 1:31] The Lamanites were totally boxed in...no bounce north, south, east, or west...Nephites had them clamped from every angle, no cap.
[Helaman 1:32] So Coriantumr shoved the Lamanites right into Nephite territory, got himself killed in the process, and the Lamanites ended up surrendering big time to the Nephites.
[Helaman 1:33] Moronihah snagged Zarahemla back and flexed mercy by letting the captured Lamanites dip out of the land in peace...no beef, just facts.
[Helaman 1:34] And that's a wrap on year 41 of the judges' reign...next chapter, say less.
[Helaman 2:1] So in year 42 of the judges, after Moronihah squared peace between Nephites and Lamanites, the judge spot was empty, sparking mad drama over who should cop that seat next.
[Helaman 2:2] Then Helaman Jr., son of Helaman, got the people's vote and snagged the judge spot...main character energy unlocked.
[Helaman 2:3] Plot twist: Kishkumen...the dude who offed Pahoran...was lurking, ready to cap Helaman too, backed by his crew who swore to keep the whole scheme on the low.
[Helaman 2:4] Enter Gadianton, smooth talker and low-key mastermind at murder and robbery, so naturally he climbed up to lead Kishkumen's squad.
[Helaman 2:5] So Gadianton rizzed up Kishkumen and the crew, pitching that if they put him in the judge's spot, he'd hook his gang up with power...hence Kishkumen schemed to take Helaman down.
[Helaman 2:6] When Kishkumen was sliding towards the judge's seat to off Helaman, one of Helaman's servants pulled a stealth move at night, lowkey snagging the tea on their murder plot through a slick disguise.
[Helaman 2:7] Then the servant crossed paths with Kishkumen, dropped a secret handshake, and Kishkumen spilled the tea...wanted the servant to lead him to the judge's spot so he could snuff Helaman.
[Helaman 2:8] After the servant caught all of Kishkumen's evil plans...murder, robbery, power grabs, the whole sus combo...he told Kishkumen, "Bet, let's roll to the judge's seat."
[Helaman 2:9] Kishkumen was mad hyped thinking he'd pull off the kill, but no cap, Helaman's servant took him out with a heart stab on the way to the judge's seat...no sound, just dead. Then he bounced to spill everything to Helaman.
[Helaman 2:10] Helaman then flexed by sending out the squad to snatch these lowkey robbers and murderers so they'd get their legal L's, no cap.
[Helaman 2:11] When Gadianton saw Kishkumen ghosted, he caught major fear of the chop and told his crew to bounce lowkey into the wilderness. So when Helaman's squad rolled through, they were straight up ghosted, nowhere to be found.
[Helaman 2:12] We'll catch more tea on Gadianton later. That wraps up year 42 of the judges running the Nephites' scene.
[Helaman 2:13] Heads up: by the end of this book, Gadianton's hustle straight-up wrecks, like almost wipes out, the whole Nephite squad.
[Helaman 2:14] Just to clear the vibe: I'm not talking about the end of Helaman's book but the end of the Nephi book, where all this tea came from.
[Helaman 3:1] Year 43 of the judges went down with basically zero beef among the Nephites...just some mild pride drama in the church that sparked minor rifts but got squared up by year's end.
[Helaman 3:2] Year 44 was straight chill with zero drama, and year 45 kept that low-key peace vibe, barely any beef at all.
[Helaman 3:3] But year 46 flipped the script...hectic beef everywhere, mad dissension, and hella folks dipped from Zarahemla heading north to claim new turf.
[Helaman 3:4] They trekked mad far, hitting up huge lakes and rivers like it was nothing.
[Helaman 3:5] For real, they spread out everywhere...even into spots not wiped out or deforested by the OG settlers who held the land first.
[Helaman 3:6] No place was straight-up dead except where trees dipped; but since the old folks got wrecked big time, those spots got tagged as desolate.
[Helaman 3:7] Timber was scarce, but those peeps got mad skills with cement, so they flexed by building cement houses to crash in.
[Helaman 3:8] They blew up in numbers, moving from south to north, basically flexing all over the map...coast to coast, sea to sea, no cap.
[Helaman 3:9] Up north, folks lived in tents and cement houses, patiently letting trees grow so they could eventually snag timber to build their houses, cities, temples, synagogues...like, the whole infrastructure flex.
[Helaman 3:10] Timber was mad rare up north, so they had to ship in hella wood from elsewhere, no cap.
[Helaman 3:11] Shipping that timber plugged the north squad so they could flex with building mad cities, rocking both wood and cement vibes.
[Helaman 3:12] A bunch of Ammon peeps, straight up Lamanites by birth, also bounced and rolled into this land.
[Helaman 3:13] Yo, lots of detailed receipts got kept by the people themselves...big-ass records covering all their moves.
[Helaman 3:14] Low-key, even 1% of the receipts on the Lamanites and Nephites...their beefs, wars, sermons, prophecies, shipbuilding, temple and synagogue flexes, their good and sus moves, murders, robberies, plundering, and all that wild chaos...can't even fit in this scroll.
[Helaman 3:15] But fr, there's hella books and receipts of all kinds, mostly kept tight by the Nephites squad.
[Helaman 3:16] The Nephites passed these records down generations but ended up caught in sin, getting murdered, robbed, hunted, exiled, slayed, and scattered everywhere...mixed with Lamanites till they lost their name and switched up hard, turning wicked, wild, and straight-up Lamanite energy.
[Helaman 3:17] Back to my receipts...what I said went down after the Nephi crew went through mad beef, chaos, wars, and drama.
[Helaman 3:18] The 46th year of the judges' reign just dipped.
[Helaman 3:19] Bet, the drama kept spilling over...still mad beef going down in year 47 and 48, no chill.
[Helaman 3:20] But Helaman ran the judge throne with straight-up fairness, kept God's rules tight, stayed on the right path 24/7, followed his dad's vibe, and low-key thrived in the land.
[Helaman 3:21] So Helaman had two sons, named the eldest Nephi and the youngest Lehi, and they started leveling up in their faith game.
[Helaman 3:22] By the tail end of year 48, the Nephites started cooling off the war vibes a bit, like low-key less beef among them.
[Helaman 3:23] By year 49 of the judges' reign, peace straight-up held down the land...except for some sus secret squads Gadianton the robber cooked up in the chill zones, and the government bigwigs had no receipts on them yet, so they stayed unchecked.
[Helaman 3:24] Same year flex...church went viral with mad growth; thousands joined, got baptized, and hit that repentance glow-up.
[Helaman 3:25] Church was booming so hard, blessings rained down so heavy even the high priests and teachers were shook beyond words.
[Helaman 3:26] The Lord's grind paid off big time...baptizing and building the church fam with tens of thousands vibing together.
[Helaman 3:27] So yeah, the Lord's mad merciful to anyone who hits Him up real talk, straight from the heart.
[Helaman 3:28] For real, heaven's gate is wide open to anyone who believes in Jesus Christ, God's own Son...no cap.
[Helaman 3:29] Straight up, anyone can grab God's word...it's fire and hits hard, slicing through all the devil's sus tricks, guiding Christ's crew on that tight, narrow path away from the eternal mess set to swallow the wicked.
[Helaman 3:30] And it'll land their immortal souls chillin' at God's right hand in heaven's squad, kicking it forever with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the OG holy crew...no cap, no leaving.
[Helaman 3:31] That year, Zarahemla and all the Nephite turf were vibing nonstop with straight-up rejoicing everywhere.
[Helaman 3:32] The last stretch of year 49 was all peace and mad joy, and year 50? Same energy...nonstop peace and big-time happiness under the judges' reign.
[Helaman 3:33] Year 51 of the judges' reign was mostly peace, but low-key pride started creeping in...not in God's true church, but in the hearts of folks claiming they were reppin' it.
[Helaman 3:34] These prideful ones flexed so hard they started persecuting their own fam, causing serious pain and making the humble crew go through mad struggles and suffering.
[Helaman 3:35] Still, the humble squad kept fasting and praying on repeat, leveling up in humility and solid faith in Christ, filling their souls with mad joy and peace, getting their hearts purified 'cause they handed them over to God, no cap.
[Helaman 3:36] Year 52 wrapped up chill with peace, except for mad pride creeping into people's hearts, all 'cause they were flexing serious wealth and land success, and that pride just kept growing daily.
[Helaman 3:37] In year 53 of the judges' reign, Helaman died and his eldest son Nephi took over, serving justice and fairness on the judgment-seat, keeping God's commandments, and walking his dad's path no cap.
[Helaman 4:1] Year 54 hit different with major beef in the church and mad drama among the people, leading to hella bloodshed...straight chaos.
[Helaman 4:2] The rebellious crew got clapped and bounced from the land, then dipped over to link up with the Lamanite king.
[Helaman 4:3] They tried hyping the Lamanites to throw hands at the Nephites, but the Lamanites were mad shook and straight-up ignored those loudmouth dissenters.
[Helaman 4:4] In year 56 of the judges' reign, some Nephite dissenters bounced to the Lamanites and actually got them heated against the Nephites, so the whole year they were busy gearing up for war.
[Helaman 4:5] Year 57, the Lamanites rolled up on the Nephites starting a deadly grind, and by year 58 they snatched Zarahemla and all the lands up to near Bountiful...big L's for the Nephites.
[Helaman 4:6] The Nephites and Moronihah's troops got pushed back hard, ending up stuck in the land of Bountiful, low-key desperate.
[Helaman 4:7] So they built up strong defenses across the land from west sea to east, covering a day's trek for a Nephite, stationing armies to guard their northern turf.
[Helaman 4:8] Those Nephite dissenters teamed up with a big Lamanite army and took over all the Nephite lands down south during years 58 and 59 of the judges' reign, no cap.
[Helaman 4:9] By year 60 of the judges' reign, Moronihah and his squad scored big, reclaiming tons of land and snatching back cities the Lamanites had taken.
[Helaman 4:10] In year 61, they bounced back hard, snagging back like half of all their lost stuff...major comeback energy.
[Helaman 4:11] No cap, the Nephites' massive L and all that bloodshed wouldn't have popped off if they hadn't been mad wicked...even the ones flexing as God's crew were catching that abomination vibe.
[Helaman 4:12] All this mess started cuz they got mad pride, flexed their crazy riches, crushed the poor by starving and naked-shaming them, slapped their humble fam, dissed sacred stuff, killed the vibe of prophecy, murdered, stole, lied, cheated, stirred up drama, and even dipped to the Lamanite lands...big sus behavior.
[Helaman 4:13] So, 'cause they were so wicked and flexing on their own power, they got left to handle their own mess...ended up failing hard, getting wrecked and chased by the Lamanites until they lost nearly all their lands.
[Helaman 4:14] But Moronihah kept preaching hard 'cause of their sins, and Nephi and Lehi, Helaman's sons, were dropping prophecy receipts about their wickedness and the bad stuff coming if they didn't hit that repentance button.
[Helaman 4:15] Then they finally copped to their sins and started to glow up...repentance unlocked the comeback, and they began to flex success.
[Helaman 4:16] When Moronihah peeped their legit repentance, he went all-in leading them city to city, grinding till they took back half their property and lands...major W energy.
[Helaman 4:17] And that's a wrap on year 61 of the judges' reign...chapter closed.
[Helaman 4:18] By year 62, Moronihah hit a wall and couldn't snatch any more land from the Lamanites...grind stalled, no cap.
[Helaman 4:19] So they dipped on plans to reclaim the rest since the Lamanites were mad numerous...Nephites just couldn't boss up more; Moronihah put all his troops on lock to hold what's left, no cap.
[Helaman 4:20] With so many Lamanites flexing, the Nephites low-key freaked, scared they'd get clapped, crushed, and wiped out for real.
[Helaman 4:21] They started recalling Alma's and Mosiah's prophecies, realizing they'd been mad stubborn, totally ghosting God's commandments like it was no big deal.
[Helaman 4:22] They peeped how they twisted and stomped on Mosiah's laws...the ones God told him to drop...and saw their laws went full corrupt, making them just as sus and wicked as the Lamanites.
[Helaman 4:23] Their wickedness tanked the church big time; folks started ghosting prophecy and revelation vibes, while God's judgments were straight-up glaring at them, no escapes.
[Helaman 4:24] They realized they'd gone soft like the Lamanites and lost God's Spirit; it dipped because the Spirit don't stick around messy, unholy places...say less.
[Helaman 4:25] So God stopped holding them up with His epic power since they fell deep into disbelief and major wickedness; they saw the Lamanites way outnumbered them, and if they didn't stick tight to God, it was game over for real.
[Helaman 4:26] They saw the Lamanites matched them strength for strength, dude for dude; all this slip-up had them going weak fast, just a few years in.
[Helaman 5:1] So in that same year, Nephi passed the judgment-seat to this guy Cezoram...said his piece and handed over the reins, no cap.
[Helaman 5:2] Since their laws and gov ran off the people's voice, and the evil crew outnumbered the good, they were straight-up headed for a L...laws gone full corrupted, no vibes.
[Helaman 5:3] For real, they were mad stubborn...so much that law and justice couldn't even boss them around unless it was leading them straight to their own downfall.
[Helaman 5:4] Nephi got mad tired of their wickedness, dipped from the judgment-seat, and decided to preach God's word for the rest of his life...his bro Lehi was on that same grind too, say less.
[Helaman 5:5] They low-key remembered the words their dad Helaman dropped on them, and here's the tea he spilled:
[Helaman 5:6] Yo sons, keep God's commandments locked in your brain; spread this message too. I gave y'all the OG names from Jerusalem so when you remember the names, you remember the moves, and knowing their vibes shows they were straight-up good.
[Helaman 5:7] So, my sons, flex that good energy so peeps say and write about you the same way they did about them...big W vibes only.
[Helaman 5:8] Now listen up, sons, I want y'all to do good not for the clout, but to stack up eternal treasure in heaven...real forever flex...and score that priceless gift of eternal life our ancestors probably copped.
[Helaman 5:9] Yo sons, for real, remember king Benjamin's words: no cap, no save without Jesus' atoning blood...He's coming to redeem the whole world, say less.
[Helaman 5:10] Also, remember Amulek's clapback to Zeezrom in Ammonihah: the Lord's for real coming to redeem His people...not stuck in their sins, but freeing them from 'em, no cap.
[Helaman 5:11] He's got the Father's power to redeem folks who repent; that's why He sent angels to drop the tea on repentance...unlocking the Redeemer's power and saving souls, no cap.
[Helaman 5:12] Yo sons, remember to build your life on the rock...our Redeemer Christ, God's Son...so when the devil throws his savage storms and hail, he can't drag you down to the abyss; this foundation's unbreakable, straight-up can't fail.
[Helaman 5:13] So Helaman schooled his sons with these words, dropping mad knowledge...some saved in writing, others low-key kept off the page.
[Helaman 5:14] They locked in Helaman's words and bounced out, keeping God's commandments and spreading His word all over Nephi, kicking off at Bountiful city, no cap.
[Helaman 5:15] From there, they rolled to Gid, then bounced to Mulek city...keeping the vibes moving.
[Helaman 5:16] They kept the hustle going city to city till they hit every Nephite down south, then crossed into Zarahemla's turf to preach to the Lamanites too, no chill.
[Helaman 5:17] They preached hard, shocking the dissenters who dipped from the Nephites so bad they fessed up, got baptized for repentance, and bounced back to fix their mess with the Nephites ASAP.
[Helaman 5:18] Nephi and Lehi came through preaching to the Lamanites with mad power and authority...God gave them both the rizz to speak and the exact receipts on what to say, no cap.
[Helaman 5:19] They spoke so fire the Lamanites were shook, 8,000 in Zarahemla and nearby got baptized for real, realizing their parents' traditions were straight-up sus and wicked, no cap.
[Helaman 5:20] Then Nephi and Lehi dipped from there, heading back to the land of Nephi, ready for the next move.
[Helaman 5:21] They got caught by a Lamanite army and thrown in the same prison where Ammon and his squad had been locked up by Limhi's crew...major sus vibes.
[Helaman 5:22] After days locked up with no food, the haters rolled up at the prison ready to off them, thinking they had the drop.
[Helaman 5:23] Nephi and Lehi got surrounded like they were in a straight-up fire ring, so no one dared touch them...was too risky...but they stayed chill, standing in the flames and somehow didn't get burned.
[Helaman 5:24] When the crowd peeped that fiery circle wasn't burning Nephi and Lehi, their hearts got mad courage vibes, low-key shook for real.
[Helaman 5:25] The Lamanites were too scared to touch or even get close...standing there like they got hit mute by pure amazement, no cap.
[Helaman 5:26] Nephi and Lehi stepped up, dropping the line: "Don't freak out, God's flexing on y'all with this crazy fire show proving y'all can't touch us to slay us."
[Helaman 5:27] Right after they said that, the earth legit shook hard and the prison walls wobbled like they'd fall, but nah, they held up; and plot twist, everyone inside were Lamanites and Nephite dissenters all packed together.
[Helaman 5:28] Then this dark cloud rolled in, low-key heavy vibes, and everyone got hit with some serious, solemn fear...like main-character energy got ghosted by the heaviness.
[Helaman 5:29] Outta nowhere, a voice boomed over the dark cloud: "Repent, rep...stop trying to cancel my crew I sent with good news, bet."
[Helaman 5:30] When they heard that voice, it wasn't like thunder or crazy noise...it was lowkey, soft AF, like a whisper that cut straight to their soul, no cap.
[Helaman 5:31] Even though the voice was chill, the earth shook hard and the prison walls were shook like they might crash down, but that dark cloud? Yeah, it stayed put, no bounce.
[Helaman 5:32] The voice showed up again like, "Repent, for real, the kingdom of heaven's sliding in; quit trying to drag down my servants." Then the earth shook and the walls did the shakes again, no chill.
[Helaman 5:33] For the third time, that voice dropped mind-blowing words no human can even clap back at, while the walls shook hard and the earth felt like it might just split apart.
[Helaman 5:34] The Lamanites were stuck, no cap...they couldn't dip 'cause that dark cloud blocked their way, and straight-up frozen by the mad fear hitting them hard.
[Helaman 5:35] Among them was this Nephite OG, born into the crew, used to ride with God's squad but then dipped and became a dissenter.
[Helaman 5:36] Dude spun around and peeped Nephi and Lehi's faces shining through that dark cloud, glowing like straight-up angels; he saw them looking heavenward, acting like they were vibing and talking to some higher being they could see.
[Helaman 5:37] This guy yelled at the crowd to turn and peep, and lowkey power hit them so they actually did...and boom, they saw Nephi and Lehi's glowing faces too.
[Helaman 5:38] They hit the man with, "Yo, what's the tea on all this? Who's the one these guys are chatting up?"
[Helaman 5:39] This dude was Aminadab, and he clapped back, "They're talking straight with God's angels, no cap."
[Helaman 5:40] The Lamanites slid up to him like, "So what's the move to get this dark cloud off our backs?"
[Helaman 5:41] Aminadab said, "You gotta repent and shout out to that voice till you get that Christ faith vibe like Alma, Amulek, and Zeezrom schooled you on; do that and the dark cloud's gonna bounce for real."
[Helaman 5:42] So, they all started yelling at the voice that shook the earth, like full-on loud cries, till that dark cloud finally dipped and bounced.
[Helaman 5:43] When they looked around and saw that dark cloud had peaced out, boom...they were all surrounded, every single one, by pillars of fire.
[Helaman 5:44] Nephi and Lehi were right in the middle, surrounded like they were chillin' inside a fire circle that didn't burn them or touch the prison walls, straight vibing with unexplainable joy and mad glory energy.
[Helaman 5:45] Then the Holy Spirit slid down from heaven, plugged into their hearts, lit them up like fire, and suddenly they were dropping mad marvelous words.
[Helaman 5:46] Then a voice rolled up...a chill, whispery vibe...saying:
[Helaman 5:47] Peace, peace to y'all 'cause of that solid faith in my Well Beloved, OG from day one of the world.
[Helaman 5:48] When they caught that, they looked up like, "Where's this voice from?" and boom...the heavens cracked open, angels slid down straight from above to serve them.
[Helaman 5:49] Around three hundred peeps saw and heard all this, and got told to move forward, no cap...no marvelling or doubting allowed.
[Helaman 5:50] So they bounced out and started ministering everywhere, flexing all the receipts of what they'd seen and heard, and low-key most Lamanites got fully convinced 'cause the evidence was too solid.
[Helaman 5:51] Anyone who got convinced straight up dropped their war gear, ditched the hate, and ghosted the old-school traditions of their dads.
[Helaman 5:52] Then they handed over their lands to the Nephites, no cap.
[Helaman 6:1] So by year 62 of the judges' reign, all this went down and most Lamanites leveled up into righteous peeps, straight outshining the Nephites 'cause their faith was rock solid and unshakable.
[Helaman 6:2] Low-key, lots of Nephites got cold-hearted and stubborn AF, fully wicked, straight up ghosting God's word and ignoring all the preaching and prophecy in their hood.
[Helaman 6:3] Still, the church crew was vibing hard, celebrating the Lamanites switching lanes and the church of God popping off among them. They linked up, shared the joy, and straight up rejoiced together.
[Helaman 6:4] Then tons of Lamanites rolled into Zarahemla, spilling the tea on how they converted and hyping the Nephites to get their faith and repentance on point.
[Helaman 6:5] Straight up, many preached with mad power and authority, pulling tons of folks down into deep humility to flex as humble followers of God and the Lamb.
[Helaman 6:6] So a bunch of Lamanites dipped to the north land, and Nephi and Lehi rolled up there too to preach, finishing off year 63 like bosses.
[Helaman 6:7] Yo, peace was popping everywhere, so Nephites flexed anywhere they wanted...Nephite turf or Lamanite hood, no cap.
[Helaman 6:8] Lamanites too were cruising wherever they pleased, Nephite or their own spots, chilling with each other, buying, selling, and stacking bread as they wanted.
[Helaman 6:9] Both Lamanites and Nephites got hella rich, flexing mad gold, silver, and all kinds of precious metals all over the south and north lands.
[Helaman 6:10] FYI, the south land was Lehi and the north was Mulek, named after Zedekiah's son...God brought Mulek up north and Lehi down south, say less.
[Helaman 6:11] Both Lehi and Mulek flexed every type of gold, silver, and rare ore, with skilled workers grinding and refining that stuff...no cap, that's how they got mad rich.
[Helaman 6:12] North and south were stacking grain like pros, thriving hard everywhere, growing mad strong, and flexing huge flocks and herds loaded with chunky fatlings.
[Helaman 6:13] Their women were grinding, spinning fine-twined linen and all kinds of cloth to keep everyone dripped out, and just like that, year 64 slid by peaceful AF.
[Helaman 6:14] Year 65 rolled in with big vibes of joy and peace, hella preaching and prophecy drops about what's next, then that year dipped out smooth.
[Helaman 6:15] Year 66 of the judges was sus as hell...Cezoram got murked by some mystery hand while chilling on the judgment-seat, and his son, who took his spot, got popped too. Year 66 closed out on that grim note.
[Helaman 6:16] At the jump of year 67, the people started catching major wicked vibes again, no chill.
[Helaman 6:17] God blessed them so hard with riches, they stayed chill, no wars or beef...but then they got greedy, chasing clout and cash to flex on each other, sliding into secret murders, robbing, and plundering just to level up.
[Helaman 6:18] So it turns out, the killers and thieves were squad goals for Kishkumen and Gadianton, with Gadianton's crew popping up big among wicked Nephites but even more hype with the shady Lamanites...they were straight-up known as Gadianton's robbers and murderers.
[Helaman 6:19] These same Gadianton clowns offed Chief Judge Cezoram and his son right on the judgment-seat, then ghosted without a trace...straight-up untouchable.
[Helaman 6:20] When the Lamanites peeped robbers in their crew, they got hella salty and threw down everything they had to wipe them out for good.
[Helaman 6:21] But low-key, Satan hyped up most Nephites' hearts so they squad-upped with these robber gangs, swearing tight oaths to have each other's backs no matter the drama, making sure no one caught hands for murders, plunders, or steals.
[Helaman 6:22] They even cooked up secret signs and passwords to ID their crew members, so no matter what nasty moves a brother pulled, his squad wouldn't rat him out or throw hands...ride or die, no cap.
[Helaman 6:23] So they were out here murdering, stealing, wildin' with whoredoms and all sorts of sus deeds, flipping off both their country's rules and God's law, no shame.
[Helaman 6:24] Anyone in their crew who snitched on their dirty deeds wasn't judged by the country's laws but by their own twisted rules cooked up by Gadianton and Kishkumen...straight-up corrupt justice.
[Helaman 6:25] So peep this: Alma told his son to keep those secret oaths and covenants on the low, 'cause dropping them worldwide would only drag the people straight into destruction.
[Helaman 6:26] FYI, those secret oaths didn't come from Helaman's records; Gadianton got them straight implanted in his heart by the same OG snake who lured our first parents into biting the forbidden fruit...straight-up devil energy.
[Helaman 6:27] Yeah, same shady dude who cooked up the plan with Cain to off Abel undercover, keeping it low-key, and ever since then, he's been scheming with Cain and his crew nonstop.
[Helaman 6:28] And it's also that same shady AF being who got people hyped to build a tower tall enough to reach heaven, then led the tower squad to this land, spreading dark vibes and messed-up deeds everywhere until he pulled the whole crew into total wreckage and eternal hell.
[Helaman 6:29] For real, it's that same shady entity who planted the urge in Gadianton to keep the dark hustle alive...secret murders and all...running since day one of humanity straight through to now.
[Helaman 6:30] Yo, he's the OG of all sin, still pushing his dark moves, secret kills, and passing down twisted plots, oaths, and evil plans generation after generation, hacking into human hearts whenever he can.
[Helaman 6:31] Low-key, this dude had Nephites wrapped around his finger so hard they went full nasty, most straying from God's path, flexing by stomping on His commands and worshipping their own bling idols made of gold and silver.
[Helaman 6:32] And no cap, all this wickedness blew up on them real quick, mostly hitting hard by year 67 of the judges' reign over Nephi's squad.
[Helaman 6:33] In year 68, they leveled up their sins even more, seriously bumming out the righteous crew who were low-key shook.
[Helaman 6:34] So yeah, the Nephites started fading out in faith and going hard on sins and gross stuff, while the Lamanites glow-upped their God knowledge and started bossing up by keeping His rules and flexing truth and integrity.
[Helaman 6:35] So the Spirit of the Lord dipped from the Nephites 'cause their hearts went full stone-cold and wicked AF.
[Helaman 6:36] Meanwhile, the Lord started flexing His Spirit on the Lamanites since they were chill and open, ready to catch His vibe and believe His words.
[Helaman 6:37] Then the Lamanites went full fetch mode on Gadianton's robbers, preaching God's word even to the worst of them, and totally wiped that gang out from their land...say less.
[Helaman 6:38] On the flip, the Nephites boosted those robbers starting with their worst players, letting them spread everywhere, low-key seducing most of the righteous to buy into their schemes, share the loot, and squad up for secret murders and shady combos.
[Helaman 6:39] So they straight-up took over the government, stomping on and throwing shade at the poor, meek, and humble God-followers like it was no big deal.
[Helaman 6:40] Bottom line, they were straight-up doomed, speeding toward eternal wreckage no cap.
[Helaman 6:41] And just like that, year 68 of the judges' run over Nephi's crew came to a close...no cap.
[Helaman 7:1] Yo, in year 69 of the judges' reign over the Nephites, Nephi son of Helaman pulled up back in Zarahemla coming down from the north.
[Helaman 7:2] He'd been out north, dropping God's word on the people and hitting them with mad prophecies...no cap.
[Helaman 7:3] But they ghosted all his messages so hard he couldn't even vibe with them, had to bounce back to his hometown.
[Helaman 7:4] Peep this: the people were straight-up toxic, Gadianton robbers ran the courts, snatching power, ignoring God's rules, acting mad sus, and tossing justice out the window for everyone.
[Helaman 7:5] They were roasting the righteous for being righteous, while the guilty got off scot-free if they had cash; then these clout-chasers snagged top spots to run the show for gain, flex, and to get away with adultery, theft, and murder on their own terms.
[Helaman 7:6] This wild wickedness hit the Nephites quick, and when Nephi saw the tea, his heart was full blown with grief, and he straight-up yelled out from the depths of his soul.
[Helaman 7:7] Man, if only I'd lived back when my dad Nephi bounced from Jerusalem...those days were the vibe: folks were chill, stuck to God's commandments, didn't catch feelings for sin quick, and were all ears to the Lord's word.
[Helaman 7:8] For real, if I had lived then, my soul would've been hyped on the good vibes of my righteous bros.
[Helaman 7:9] But look, I'm stuck in these times, and my soul's gonna be hella heavy 'cause my own fam's straight-up wildin' in wickedness.
[Helaman 7:10] So, Nephi was posted up on a tower in his garden by the main road to Zarahemla's chief market, low-key chilling near the garden gate next to the highway.
[Helaman 7:11] Some dudes rolled past and caught Nephi spilling his soul to God on the tower; they dipped to spread the tea, so crowds assembled trying to peep why he was so shook over the people's wickedness.
[Helaman 7:12] When Nephi got up, he saw the massive crowd that had clumped together.
[Helaman 7:13] Then Nephi spoke up: Yo, why y'all gathered here? You wanna hear me roast your sins or what?
[Helaman 7:14] Yeah, I'm up here pouring my soul out to God 'cause my heart's straight-up crushed from how sus y'all've been acting.
[Helaman 7:15] 'Cause I'm out here mourning hard, y'all pulled up all curious...and honestly, you should be shook, 'cause the devil's low-key running wild in your hearts.
[Helaman 7:16] For real, how'd you let yourselves get played by the dude who's out here trying to drag your souls straight to eternal misery and nonstop pain?
[Helaman 7:17] Yo, repent for real! Why you tryna die like that? Bounce back and vibe with the Lord your God. Why you letting Him ghost you?
[Helaman 7:18] It's 'cause you've been low-key heartless, refusing to hear the good shepherd's call, straight-up making Him mad at y'all.
[Helaman 7:19] Look, if you don't repent, instead of squad goals, He's gonna scatter y'all so bad you're gonna end up like snacks for dogs and wild beasts.
[Helaman 7:20] Seriously, how'd you ghost your God on the very day He saved your ass?
[Helaman 7:21] But nope, it's all about chasing clout and stacks of gold and silver ... y'all so obsessed with flexing worldly riches you're out here murdering, stealing, snitching, and straight-up toxic with every kind of sin.
[Helaman 7:22] So heads up, unless y'all repent, doom's coming. If you keep flexing that stubbornness, this big city and all the nearby ones we got will get wrecked 'cause the Lord won't back you with the strength He usually does to hold off your enemies.
[Helaman 7:23] The Lord's basically saying: I won't flex my strength for the wicked, no cap, except for those who actually repent and listen up. So real talk, fam, it's gonna be better for the Lamanites than for you unless you turn back.
[Helaman 7:24] Straight up, they're living cleaner than you 'cause they haven't dissed the big knowledge you got; so the Lord's gonna vibe mercy on them, bless their days and fam, while y'all get wiped out if you don't repent.
[Helaman 7:25] Yo, big L's coming your way 'cause of that nasty abomination in your crew...you've all linked up with that lowkey sus secret squad Gadianton set up!
[Helaman 7:26] Deadass, y'all're catching big L's 'cause you let pride slide in and inflate your ego way past chill just 'cause you're swimming in mad riches!
[Helaman 7:27] Bet, big trouble's coming for y'all 'cause of your straight-up wickedness and nasty abominations!
[Helaman 7:28] No cap, if you don't repent, you're done...your lands gone, and you'll be wiped off the map for real.
[Helaman 7:29] Look, I'm not just pulling this outta nowhere...God showed me the receipts, so trust me when I say these things are 100% real and about to go down.
[Helaman 8:1] So after Nephi dropped those truths, some judges who lowkey roll with Gadianton got mad and started yelling, "Why aren't y'all snatching this dude to roast him for his crimes?"
[Helaman 8:2] Yo, why you just watching this guy trash-talk our people and our laws like it's all good?
[Helaman 8:3] Fact is, Nephi called out how sus their laws were; he said mad stuff that's too deep to even write down, but none of it broke God's commandments.
[Helaman 8:4] Those judges got mad 'cause Nephi exposed their shady secret moves, but they didn't dare touch him 'cause they low-key feared the crowd would start throwing receipts back at them.
[Helaman 8:5] So they started yelling at the crowd, "Why y'all letting this dude roast us? He's throwing shade on everyone, saying we're headed for total destruction and losing our cities with nowhere to chill."
[Helaman 8:6] Nah fam, that's impossible...our squad's built, cities are massive, so no way enemies can flex on us.
[Helaman 8:7] So they stirred up the crowd to vibe mad salty at Nephi, sparking beef; but some were like, "Chill, this dude's legit, and his warnings are straight fire unless we bounce back and repent."
[Helaman 8:8] Bet, all those judgments he warned will hit us 'cause we know he's 100% right about our mad sins, and he's got the full tea on what's coming just like he knows our mess-ups.
[Helaman 8:9] No cap, if he wasn't a prophet, there's no way he could've dropped those legit predictions.
[Helaman 8:10] So, the haters wanted to clap back at Nephi but got shook and didn't touch him; now he's back at it, preaching, cause some peeps lowkey vibe with him and the rest are scared.
[Helaman 8:11] So Nephi was like, "Fam, didn't you read how God hooked up Moses with the power to split the Red Sea so our ancestors could flex through dry land while the Egyptian squad got dunked?"
[Helaman 8:12] Look, if God blessed Moses with that mad power, why y'all beefing and saying I got zero juice to know the judgments headed your way if you don't bounce back?
[Helaman 8:13] But fr, y'all ain't just ignoring my vibe, you're canceling all our ancestors' words plus Moses'...the same Moses with crazy power who dropped bars about the Messiah coming.
[Helaman 8:14] Yo, didn't Moses testify that the Son of God was coming? Just like he raised that bronze serpent in the desert, the Son will be lifted up too.
[Helaman 8:15] Real talk, anyone who peeped that serpent survived, same way anyone who looks at the Son of God with solid faith and a humble heart will vibe forever in eternal life.
[Helaman 8:16] Bet, Moses wasn't the only one dropping receipts...literally all the OG prophets from his time through Abraham's were on the same page.
[Helaman 8:17] No cap, Abraham got the sneak peek of the Son's arrival and straight-up flexed with joy, totally hyped.
[Helaman 8:18] For real, Abraham wasn't just in the know...plenty before him got God's call, straight up following the Son's order, showing the squad way in advance that redemption was coming through, like thousands of years early.
[Helaman 8:19] Just so you know, since Abraham's era, tons of prophets have been shouting this truth; Zenos was all in, spit fire bold enough to get himself killed.
[Helaman 8:20] And yo, Zenock, Ezias, Isaiah, plus Jeremiah...yeah, that Jeremiah who called out Jerusalem's wipeout...proved their receipts right when the city got wrecked; so why wouldn't the Son of God show up like he said? Say less.
[Helaman 8:21] So, you gonna deny Jerusalem got clapped? Say the sons of Zedekiah didn't die except Mulek? Bruh, their lineage is with us now, exiled from Jerusalem's turf. But hold up, there's more...
[Helaman 8:22] Our OG Lehi got booted from Jerusalem for dropping these truths. Nephi and basically all our ancestors since then have been hyping the Christ's arrival, stanning and stoked for his day to drop.
[Helaman 8:23] Look, he's God, chillin' with them, showed up so they knew they were saved by him, and they gave him mad props for what's about to go down.
[Helaman 8:24] Since y'all know this is facts but still flexin' denial, you're straight-up sinning by ignoring all the receipts...heaven and earth got your back as proof, no cap.
[Helaman 8:25] But fr, y'all are ghosting the truth and side-eying the holy God; instead of stacking heavenly clout that stays fresh forever, you're just building mad wrath for judgment day.
[Helaman 8:26] Real talk, right now you're cooking your own downfall with all the murder, fornication, and bad vibes...eternal wreckage incoming unless you hit the brakes and repent, no cap.
[Helaman 8:27] Yo, judgment's legit at your doorstep; check this...your judge got iced, laying in his own blood, killed by his own brother who's tryna snatch that judgment seat flex.
[Helaman 8:28] And get this...they're both part of your low-key Gadianton crew, run by that big bad boss who's out here trying to wreck souls.
[Helaman 9:1] So, after Nephi dropped those bars, some dudes from the crowd bounced to the judgment-seat...five of them flexing...and were low-key chatting as they rolled up.
[Helaman 9:2] Bet, we're about to get receipts on whether this dude's actually a prophet and God gave him the green light to drop these wild predictions. TBH, we're low-key sus and don't believe he's legit, but if the judge really dead like he said, we might have to stan those other words too.
[Helaman 9:3] They dipped mad quick and rolled up to the judgment-seat; no cap, the chief judge was flat out on the ground, soaking in his own blood.
[Helaman 9:4] When they peeped that scene, they got shook AF and literally dropped to the ground, 'cause they never thought Nephi's words about the judge would hit that hard.
[Helaman 9:5] Now that they saw the tea was real, they finally believed and got mad scared all Nephi's judgments might drop on everyone...so they shook and hit the ground, no cap.
[Helaman 9:6] Right after the judge got iced...stabbed by his bro under mad secret vibes...the killer dipped, servants ran to spill the tea, and chaos popped off with murder rumors everywhere.
[Helaman 9:7] So the crowd pulled up to the judgment-seat spot...and low-key freaked when they saw those same five dudes still flat on the ground, knocked out.
[Helaman 9:8] The crowd had zero clue about the big crew chilling at Nephi's garden, so they low-key blamed these dudes on the ground as the judge's killers, thinking God smacked them so they couldn't ghost.
[Helaman 9:9] They grabbed those guys, cuffed 'em, and threw them in jail. Then they blasted the news that the judge got killed and the suspects were locked up.
[Helaman 9:10] Next day, the whole squad rolled up to mourn and fast at the funeral of the big-shot chief judge who got clapped.
[Helaman 9:11] Even the judges who were at Nephi's garden catching his vibe showed up to the burial, no cap.
[Helaman 9:12] They asked the crowd, "Yo, where those five sent to check if the chief judge was dead?" The people clapped back, "IDK about those five, but these five locked up? They're the killers for sure."
[Helaman 9:13] The judges wanted those five brought in, and when they showed up, turns out they were the ones sent; the judges grilled them, and they spilled all the tea on what went down.
[Helaman 9:14] We ran to the judgment-seat and saw everything just like Nephi said...got shook so hard we dropped to the ground; then, once we caught ourselves, they just tossed us in jail.
[Helaman 9:15] About the murder? We got no clue who pulled that stunt; all we know is we showed up like you asked, and yup, he was dead just like Nephi said.
[Helaman 9:16] The judges spilled the tea to the crowd, shouting that Nephi had to be in on the judge's murder, hoping to flex as some bigshot prophet and pull people to his squad.
[Helaman 9:17] Bet, we're gonna expose this guy, get him to spill the receipts, and reveal who really iced the judge.
[Helaman 9:18] On the funeral day, the five got sprung, but they clapped back hard at the judges' shade on Nephi, debating them one-on-one until the judges got straight-up wrecked.
[Helaman 9:19] Still, they snatched Nephi, cuffed him, dragged him in front of the crowd, and started grilling him with all sorts of sus questions, trying to trap him and accuse him to death.
[Helaman 9:20] They hit him with, "You're in on this...who actually killed the guy? Spill the tea and admit your fail. Look, here's cash, and we'll let you live if you confess you cooked this up with him."
[Helaman 9:21] Nephi clapped back, "Bruh, you dumb, heartless, blind, stubborn clowns...how long y'all think God's gonna let you keep running this sin game?"
[Helaman 9:22] Yo, y'all should be straight-up howling and mourning 'cause major disaster's looming if you don't hit that repentance button ASAP.
[Helaman 9:23] Y'all say I teamed up with someone to off Seezoram, the chief judge? Nah, I'm just testifying so y'all get the receipts and know how deep the wickedness and messed-up vibes run among you.
[Helaman 9:24] Just 'cause I dropped the receipts, y'all say I plotted the whole murder; showing this sign got you mad, and now y'all wanna end me.
[Helaman 9:25] Bet, I'm about to flex another sign...let's see if y'all still wanna come for me after this.
[Helaman 9:26] Look, I'm telling y'all: roll up to Seantum's crib...he's Seezoram's brother...and drop this message on him...
[Helaman 9:27] Has Nephi, the so-called prophet always spitting bad news about y'all, teamed up with you to murk your bro Seezoram?
[Helaman 9:28] And watch, he'll straight-up tell you, Nah.
[Helaman 9:29] Then you hit him with: Did you kill your own brother?
[Helaman 9:30] He'll freeze up, clueless on what to say, then deny it, act all shocked, but still insist he's clean.
[Helaman 9:31] But check him out closely...you'll spot blood stains on the hem of his cloak, no cap.
[Helaman 9:32] When you peep that, ask him straight up: Where'd this blood come from? We all know it's your brother's, no lies.
[Helaman 9:33] Then he'll shake and go ghost-white like death just slid into his DMs.
[Helaman 9:34] Peep the fear and how your face just ghosted...yeah, that's cap, we know you're busted.
[Helaman 9:35] Then he'll catch even bigger fear vibes and spill the tea...no more denying, he owned up to the murder.
[Helaman 9:36] Then he'll say, "Nephi only knows what God's power handed him." That's when you vibe check and realize I'm legit, sent straight from God.
[Helaman 9:37] So they rolled through just like Nephi said, and low-key, his words checked out...guy denied, then confessed exactly as predicted.
[Helaman 9:38] They proved straight up he was the actual killer, so the five got their freedom back...and Nephi too, no cap.
[Helaman 9:39] Some Nephites vibed with Nephi's words, others got on board 'cause the five's testimony hit different...they converted while locked up.
[Helaman 9:40] Now, some folks started calling Nephi a straight-up prophet, no cap.
[Helaman 9:41] Others said, "Yo, he's gotta be a god...only a god-level being could peep our hearts, spill tea on our secrets, and snitch the real killer of our chief judge."
[Helaman 10:1] Things got mad messy...people split up, bounced every which way, leaving Nephi solo, just chillin' right in their middle.
[Helaman 10:2] Nephi dipped back to his crib, deep in thought about all the wild stuff the Lord just dropped on him.
[Helaman 10:3] While Nephi was deep in his feels, low-key crushed by the Nephites' sus darkness, murders, thefts, and all-out evil, suddenly a voice slid into his mind like, "Say less."
[Helaman 10:4] Blessed, Nephi, fr...I've seen how you've been grinding nonstop, dropping my word to these peeps, no cap. You didn't flex fear or chase your own safety, just chased my vibe and kept my rules tight.
[Helaman 10:5] Since you've been grinding so hard without quitting, I'm gonna bless you forever...making you flex in word and action, faith and deeds; basically, everything you ask for goes down, as long as you don't ask for stuff against my will.
[Helaman 10:6] Yo, you're Nephi and I'm God...front row with my angels watching...you're gonna hold power over these folks and drop famine, plagues, and destruction on the land, all matching their level of wickedness.
[Helaman 10:7] I'm handing you the keys...whatever you seal on earth gets sealed in heaven, whatever you loose down here gets loose upstairs too; that's the big flex you'll have over these people.
[Helaman 10:8] So if you tell this temple to split in two, bet, it's gonna happen.
[Helaman 10:9] And if you tell this mountain to get wrecked and flattened, no cap, it's done.
[Helaman 10:10] And fr, if you say God's gonna clobber these people, it's a wrap...it's gonna happen.
[Helaman 10:11] So listen up, I'm commanding you to go drop the Lord Almighty's word: repent or get smacked down hard, straight to destruction.
[Helaman 10:12] After God laid that down, Nephi didn't bounce to his crib; instead, he rolled back to the scattered crowds and started flexing God's warning about destruction if they didn't repent.
[Helaman 10:13] Despite the massive W Nephi pulled off predicting the chief judge's death, these clowns just hardened their hearts and ghosted the Lord's words.
[Helaman 10:14] So Nephi kept it 100, dropping the Lord's message: repent or get smacked hard, like total destruction vibes.
[Helaman 10:15] Even after Nephi spilled the Lord's truth, these guys stayed stubborn, flexed disrespect, and tried to snatch him up to throw him in jail.
[Helaman 10:16] But no cap, God's power was on Nephi's side, so they couldn't cuff him...Spirit swooped in and yeeted him right outta their reach.
[Helaman 10:17] So Nephi vibed in the Spirit, hopping from crowd to crowd, spreading God's word till everyone got the memo.
[Helaman 10:18] They straight-up ignored his words, and drama exploded...people split up and started beef so bad they ended up killing each other with swords.
[Helaman 10:19] And just like that, the 71st year of the judges running the show over Nephi's crew came to a close.
[Helaman 11:1] Year 72 of the judges' reign slid in hot with beef escalating, turning the whole Nephi squad's land into full-on war mode.
[Helaman 11:2] It was this low-key gang of robbers flexing mad destruction and wicked vibes...the war dragged through that whole year and kept flexing into year 73 too.
[Helaman 11:3] So in that year, Nephi hit up the Lord with a straight-up prayer, no cap.
[Helaman 11:4] Yo Lord, don't let these folks get wiped out by swords; better hit 'em with a famine to snap them back and maybe they'll actually repent and vibe with You.
[Helaman 11:5] Facts: Nephi's words came through. A savage famine hit Nephi's peeps hard. Year 74 kept that famine grind going...swords went quiet, but hunger was the real savage.
[Helaman 11:6] Year 75 kept the destruction flexin' ... the earth was hella dry, no grain drop when it should've. Both Lamanites and Nephites got hit hard, with thousands dying in the sketchiest spots.
[Helaman 11:7] When famine nearly wiped them out, people finally got the memo and started remembering the Lord and Nephi's words.
[Helaman 11:8] The crowd came at their leaders like, "Yo, tell Nephi we know he's legit with God...ask Him to ditch this famine before Nephi's doom prophecies hit full send."
[Helaman 11:9] The judges hit up Nephi like the people wanted, and when Nephi peeped their real repentance drippin' in sackcloth vibes, he doubled down and prayed to the Lord again.
[Helaman 11:10] Yo Lord, peep this...these folks are for real repentin'; they straight-up wiped out the Gadianton crew, made 'em vanish, and buried all their sus plans deep underground.
[Helaman 11:11] Lord, since they're low-key humble now, can You chill with the wrath and just finish off those already-destroyed wicked dudes? Say less.
[Helaman 11:12] Yo Lord, can You cancel that savage rage and make this famine dip out from the land?
[Helaman 11:13] Lord, listen up...make it happen like I said and drop rain on the land so it can flex with fruit and grain right on time.
[Helaman 11:14] Lord, You heard me when I called for famine to pause the sword's chaos, and I'm betting You're still listening now 'cause You said if they repent, You'd spare them...bet.
[Helaman 11:15] For sure, Lord, You see they flipped the script and repented 'cause famine, pestilence, and destruction hit them hard.
[Helaman 11:16] Alright Lord, can You chill the rage and give them a second shot to serve You? If they do, You know You can bless them like You promised.
[Helaman 11:17] So, in year seventy-six, the Lord cooled His anger and flexed some rain that made the earth drop fruit and grain right on season...nature's glow-up, no cap.
[Helaman 11:18] The people vibed hard, hyped up God, the whole land was lit with joy; they stopped roasting Nephi and gave him mad props as a top prophet with God-given clout.
[Helaman 11:19] And check it, Lehi, his brother, was no cap just as solid on the righteousness flex.
[Helaman 11:20] So the Nephites bounced back, glowin' up their ruins, multiplying and spreading all over...from north to south, sea to sea...straight-up took over the whole land.
[Helaman 11:21] Year seventy-six wrapped up with peace, year seventy-seven kicked off the same vibe; the church blew up everywhere, most Nephites and Lamanites joined in, and the land was straight-up chill...peace game strong at year's end.
[Helaman 11:22] Even in year seventy-eight, peace was the mood...except for some petty beefs over prophet-approved doctrine stuff.
[Helaman 11:23] Year seventy-nine started with mad drama, but Nephi, Lehi, and their crew...who had the real tea from daily revelations...preached hard and shut down the beef before year-end.
[Helaman 11:24] So, in year eighty of the judges' reign, some ex-Nephites who ghosted over to the Lamanites and repped that crew, plus actual Lamanite descendants hyped up by them, started beef and kicked off a war against their own fam.
[Helaman 11:25] They were out here killing and looting, then dipped into the mountains and wilderness to hide lowkey, stacking up numbers daily 'cause more dissenters kept sliding through.
[Helaman 11:26] Fast forward just a few years, and they stacked up into a massive squad of robbers, digging up all Gadianton's secret hacks...basically Gadianton-level thieves now.
[Helaman 11:27] Yo, these robbers were straight-up wreaking havoc, causing mad destruction both on the Nephites and the Lamanites.
[Helaman 11:28] It was clear they had to shut down this destruction, so they sent a squad of tough dudes into the wilderness and mountains to hunt down and wipe out the robbers.
[Helaman 11:29] But, no cap, that same year the robbers got pushed back all the way into their own turf...so year eighty of the judges' reign closed out on that note.
[Helaman 11:30] Starting year eighty-one, they rolled out again to crush the robbers, taking down a bunch...but they also caught mad damage themselves.
[Helaman 11:31] They had to dip back from the wilderness and mountains to their own land 'cause the robbers were way too many, swarming everywhere.
[Helaman 11:32] That year wrapped up with the robbers only getting bigger and stronger, low-key flexing on the Nephite and Lamanite armies, spreading major fear across the whole land.
[Helaman 11:33] They hit up mad spots across the land, wrecking everything, killing tons, and snatching others...especially women and kids...into the wilderness.
[Helaman 11:34] This huge mess that hit them 'cause of their sins low-key pushed them to remember the Lord their God again.
[Helaman 11:35] And just like that, year eighty-one of the judges' reign came to a close.
[Helaman 11:36] By year eighty-two, they started ghosting the Lord again; year eighty-three, their sin game leveled up hard; and year eighty-four, no chill...they didn't fix their ways at all.
[Helaman 11:37] Come year eighty-five, they were leveling up in pride and wickedness like no cap, basically gearing up for another epic fail.
[Helaman 11:38] So yeah, year eighty-five wrapped up just like that.
[Helaman 12:1] Low-key, you can peep how flaky and shaky human hearts are; but for real, the Lord's infinite goodness blesses and vibes with those who actually trust Him.
[Helaman 12:2] So even when God's blessing them with booming crops, mad flocks, gold, silver, saving their skins, softening enemy vibes, and straight-up hooking them up for happiness, they still big-brain harden their hearts, forget God, and step on the Holy One...all 'cause they're too comfy and flexing on that crazy wealth.
[Helaman 12:3] Basically, unless God hits them with tough times...death, terror, famine, and all kinds of plague...they're not gonna remember Him, no cap.
[Helaman 12:4] Man, humans be straight-up dumb, petty, sus, and wicked...always quick to hit the sin button, slow on the good vibes, and all ears for the devil's rizz, chasing those empty worldly clout-chases.
[Helaman 12:5] For real, they're mad quick to flex pride, brag hard, and dive into sin, but slow as hell to remember God or vibe with His wisdom.
[Helaman 12:6] Facts: they don't even want the Lord...their Creator...to run the show, and despite His mad kindness and mercy, they ghost His advice and refuse Him as their guide.
[Helaman 12:7] Yo, the worthlessness of humans is insane...they're literally less than dust on the ground.
[Helaman 12:8] Peep this: even dust bounces around and splits up just 'cause our big-time eternal God says so.
[Helaman 12:9] No cap, when He speaks, hills and mountains straight-up shake and quake like they just caught a bad vibe.
[Helaman 12:10] Facts: His voice can smash mountains down and smooth 'em out, turning peaks into chill valleys.
[Helaman 12:11] Deadass, His voice makes the whole earth wobble like it's caught in a serious vibe check.
[Helaman 12:12] For real, His voice shakes the earth's foundations all the way to the core...no cap.
[Helaman 12:13] Bet, if He tells the earth to move, it moves...no questions asked.
[Helaman 12:14] Straight up, if He tells the earth to rewind so the day lasts mad longer, it happens, no cap.
[Helaman 12:15] So basically, by His command, the earth rewinds, making people think the sun's frozen...but nah, it's the earth flexing the move, not the sun.
[Helaman 12:16] And yo, if He orders the deep waters to dry up? Boom, done and dusted...no cap.
[Helaman 12:17] Straight facts: If He tells a mountain to rise up and crash onto a city burying it? Bet, it goes down exactly like that.
[Helaman 12:18] Low-key, if a dude buries treasure and the Lord calls it cursed 'cause of that dude's mess, then yeah, it's straight-up cursed, no debate.
[Helaman 12:19] Bet, if the Lord says, "Stay cursed and stay hidden forever," then deadass, nobody snags that treasure ever again.
[Helaman 12:20] No cap, if the Lord tells a dude "You're cursed forever 'cause of your sins," then that's the deal, for real.
[Helaman 12:21] Facts: If the Lord declares, "You're banned from my presence for your sins," He makes sure that's 100% the move.
[Helaman 12:22] Big yikes for anyone the Lord drops that sentence on...no cap, they're stuck in sin with no save button; that's why repentance got announced, so folks can catch the W.
[Helaman 12:23] For real, mad blessings on those who hit that repentance grind and vibe with God's voice...they're the ones snagging eternal Ls turned into Ws.
[Helaman 12:24] Big pray: May God, in His epic fullness, pull people into repentance and good deeds so they flex back into grace, level by level, based on their grind.
[Helaman 12:25] Low-key, I want everyone saved, no cap, but scripture says on the final day, some get ghosted...straight-up cut off from God's squad.
[Helaman 12:26] Deadass, some get stuck in eternal misery, 'cause the receipts say: good vibes mean eternal life, evil deeds lock you in eternal damnation. Facts. Amen.
[Helaman 13:1] So, by year 86, the Nephites were still deep in their wicked ways, no cap, while the Lamanites were low-key crushing it, sticking hard to God's commandments and Moses' rulebook.
[Helaman 13:2] So, this year, Samuel the Lamanite rolled up to Zarahemla and started preaching repentance nonstop, but the people threw shade and bounced him back toward his homeland.
[Helaman 13:3] Then bam, God hit Samuel with the vibe check...told him to bounce back and drop prophecy straight from the heart.
[Helaman 13:4] The city squad said "nah" to letting him in, so Samuel climbed the wall, raised his voice, and spit the Lord's prophecies loud and clear, straight from his heart.
[Helaman 13:5] Samuel came thru like, "Yo, I'm a Lamanite, but I'm dropping God's words straight from my heart: justice's sword is hanging over y'all, and no cap, in 400 years, it's gonna land hard on this crew."
[Helaman 13:6] Deadass, major destruction's looming, no escape unless y'all repent and put faith in Jesus Christ, who's def coming, gonna suffer big time, and get slain for the squad.
[Helaman 13:7] For real, an angel dropped this news on me...straight up lit vibes for my soul...and I came to share it with y'all, but y'all low-key rejected the message.
[Helaman 13:8] So God's like: since the Nephites got mad hard-hearted, if they don't repent, I'm ghosting them...pulling my word and Spirit, no cap, and flipping their own fam's hearts against them.
[Helaman 13:9] Bet, within 400 years, I'mma smite 'em hard...bringing the sword, famine, and plague straight to their doorstep.
[Helaman 13:10] No cap, God's coming at y'all with fierce rage; by the fourth gen, your enemies gonna be alive to watch y'all get wrecked...unless y'all repent, facts.
[Helaman 13:11] But real talk, if y'all flip and come back to God, He'll chill on the anger...He's all about blessing those who repent, but big L for anyone who don't.
[Helaman 13:12] Yo, Zarahemla's in deep trouble...only the righteous crew keeps it afloat, but most of the city's gonna low-key harden up and say "nah" to God, says the Lord.
[Helaman 13:13] Bless up to those who repent...I'm sparing y'all. But fr, if it weren't for the righteous in Zarahemla, I'd straight fire down from heaven and wipe the place.
[Helaman 13:14] It's only 'cause of the righteous that Zarahemla's still chillin', but heads up: when y'all exile the good ones, destruction's next up...big L for the city 'cause of all the wicked vibes and abominations.
[Helaman 13:15] And straight up, Gideon's getting the same L for all the wickedness and abominations running wild there.
[Helaman 13:16] Yo, every city around Nephite turf's catching mad L's too, all 'cause of the wickedness and abominations lurking inside.
[Helaman 13:17] Heads up, God's dropping a curse on this land, straight up for all the wickedness and abominations the people flex around here.
[Helaman 13:18] God's saying: anyone stashing treasure underground won't find it again 'cause of the land's mad curse...unless they're righteous and hide it for the Lord, then say less.
[Helaman 13:19] God's word: treasures gotta be hidden for Him; if not, big cursed vibes on both the hoarder and the loot...only the righteous play this game right, or else no redemption, straight cursed land energy.
[Helaman 13:20] One day, folks who're all about the cash will stash their treasures while fleeing their enemies...but since they ain't hiding it for Me, God's saying both them and their loot will catch major L's and get smacked down.
[Helaman 13:21] Yo, Zarahemla fam, listen up...God's saying y'all are cursed 'cause you're all about your riches, and your cash is cursed too since you ignored the One who actually gave it to you.
[Helaman 13:22] Y'all straight up forget God while flexing on your blessings, only flexing your riches without giving Him props; your hearts packed with pride, bragging, envy, fights, hate, and even murder...basically peak sin vibes.
[Helaman 13:23] That's why God dropped a curse on the land and your stacks...y'all's iniquities called it in, no cap.
[Helaman 13:24] Big woah to y'all for throwing shade at prophets, mocking, stoning, even killing them...same savage moves from way back when, and God ain't vibing.
[Helaman 13:25] Now y'all talk mad tough like, "If we lived back in our forefathers' days, we'd never kill or stone or throw out the prophets"...big cap energy.
[Helaman 13:26] Low-key, y'all are even worse; for real, if a prophet drops God's receipts on your sins, you get mad, kick him out, and plot all ways to cancel him...calling him fake, a sinner, even devil's spawn just 'cause he called out your bad moves.
[Helaman 13:27] But watch...if some dude shows up preaching, "Do whatever you want, no sin here," flexing pride and selfish vibes, y'all will stan him and call him a prophet.
[Helaman 13:28] For real, y'all hype him up, throw your gold and silver at him, deck him out in drip, and since he's all about that sweet talk saying "everything's Gucci," y'all won't call him out on his sus vibes.
[Helaman 13:29] Yo, wicked and sus crew, how long you think God's gonna let y'all slide? How long you gonna let dumb, blind leaders play you? Seriously, how long you gonna pick darkness over the glow-up?
[Helaman 13:30] No cap, God's already heated at y'all; He straight cursed the land 'cause of your messy sins.
[Helaman 13:31] Heads up, the curse's about to hit your riches so they slip right through your fingers, and when poverty hits, you won't even keep a dime.
[Helaman 13:32] When poverty hits, you'll scream to God but it's too late...destruction's locked in, and you'll be crying and howling hard, finally regretting it big time, says the Lord of Hosts.
[Helaman 13:33] "Bruh, I wish I'd flipped the script, not killed or stoned the prophets or tossed them out." On that day, y'all'll be like, "Man, we should've remembered God when He blessed our bags, so they wouldn't have slipped away...now it's all ghosted."
[Helaman 13:34] Look, we leave a tool down and next day it's vanished; our swords get snatched right when we need 'em for the fight...big L energy.
[Helaman 13:35] Yeah, we stashed our treasures but they dipped on us, all thanks to the land's savage curse.
[Helaman 13:36] Man, if only we'd repented when God's word dropped on us; now the land's cursed, everything's slipping through our fingers, and we can't keep a grip.
[Helaman 13:37] Look, we're boxed in by demons and the angels of the dude trying to wreck our souls; our sins are mad deep. Yo Lord, can you chill and ditch the rage? That's the vibe you'll be throwing then.
[Helaman 13:38] Yo, your time to flex that salvation pass is done; you kept ghosting the chance till it's forever a no-go, and destruction's locked in. You spent your whole life chasing stuff you can't get, tryna find happiness in sin...even though that's straight-up against the vibe of the big Eternal Boss upstairs.
[Helaman 13:39] Yo, people of the land, listen up to my words! I'm hoping God chills His anger on you and you hit that repentance so you can catch salvation's W.
[Helaman 14:1] So Samuel the Lamanite dropped mad prophecies, way too many to even jot down, no cap.
[Helaman 14:2] Samuel told 'em, "Peep this sign: in five years flat, the Son of God pulls up to save everyone who vibes with His name."
[Helaman 14:3] Here's the sign when He shows up: the sky's gonna flex mad lights so hard that the night looks like straight-up day, no cap.
[Helaman 14:4] So, there'll be a day, then night, then day again all squished like one day with no real night...big sign vibes. You'll peep the sun rise and set, proving two days and a night for real; still, that night won't be dark...it's the night before His birth, bet.
[Helaman 14:5] Yo, a fresh star's gonna pop up, like nothing you've ever seen before...straight-up sign alert.
[Helaman 14:6] And fam, that's just the start...there'll be mad signs and crazy wonders up in the sky.
[Helaman 14:7] Everyone's gonna be shook, straight-up mind-blown to the point you'll hit the ground, no cap.
[Helaman 14:8] Bet, anyone who puts faith in the Son of God locks in eternal life, no cap.
[Helaman 14:9] So listen up, God's angel told me to drop this prophecy on you: shout to the crowd, repent and get the path ready for the Lord...say less.
[Helaman 14:10] Low-key, since I'm a Lamanite and spilled God's truth, y'all got mad salty and wanna cancel me, even kicked me out the squad.
[Helaman 14:11] I'm here on the city walls so y'all hear my words, get the receipts on God's judgments coming for your sins, and catch the vibe on how to repent.
[Helaman 14:12] Also, so you know Jesus Christ's flex...Son of God, Creator OG of heaven and earth...and catch the signs of His arrival to boost your faith in His name, no cap.
[Helaman 14:13] If you put your trust in His name, you'll bounce from your sins and get them wiped clean thanks to His grind.
[Helaman 14:14] Yo, here's another sign for you...straight-up proof of His death, say less.
[Helaman 14:15] Real talk, He gotta die so salvation drops; it's necessary for Him to bounce to make the resurrection happen, so we can roll up to the Lord's presence.
[Helaman 14:16] No cap, His death sparks the resurrection and saves everyone from the OG death...spiritual death; since Adam's fall ghosted us from God's presence, we're basically dead in both real life and spirit.
[Helaman 14:17] Check it, Christ's resurrection pulls all humanity back from the dead and reconnects us with the Lord's squad, no cap.
[Helaman 14:18] Straight up, repentance is the vibe check...if you repent you dodge getting cut down and tossed into the fire; if not, you get roasted and hit with spiritual death again, that second death, meaning you're ghosted from righteousness all over again.
[Helaman 14:19] Bet, repent for real, or knowing all this and ignoring it will just get you dunked under condemnation and sent straight to that second death, no cap.
[Helaman 14:20] Like I said, on the day He dies, the sun's gonna ghost y'all...dark mode activated...no light from sun, moon, or stars for three days straight until He pops back up from the dead.
[Helaman 14:21] When He breathes His last, expect thunder and lightning flexing for hours; the earth's gonna shake and quake so hard even the solid rocks above and below will break apart, no cap.
[Helaman 14:22] For real, those rocks get split in half and from then on stay like that...in seams, cracks, and broken pieces all over the earth, above and below.
[Helaman 14:23] Yo, wild storms gonna rage, mountains getting leveled like valleys, and valleys flipping the script to giant mountains...nature pulling mad plot twists.
[Helaman 14:24] Tons of roads gonna get wrecked, and whole cities will be left ghosted and empty, no cap.
[Helaman 14:25] Loads of graves gonna pop open, spilling out mad dead folks; plus, many saints will slide up and appear to a bunch of people.
[Helaman 14:26] For real, the angel told me straight up there's gonna be thunder and lightning flexing non-stop for hours on end.
[Helaman 14:27] The angel said that during all the thunder, lightning, and storms, darkness gonna blackout the whole earth for three days straight, no cap.
[Helaman 14:28] The angel said plenty will witness even crazier stuff so no one can flex unbelief about these signs hitting the whole land...say less, believe up.
[Helaman 14:29] So basically, whoever vibes with belief gets saved, but those ghosting it will catch righteous judgment, and if they get dunked, it's on them...no cap, self-inflicted L.
[Helaman 14:30] Yo, remember this: if you bite the dust, it's on you; if you do wrong, you're the one catching the heat...God gave y'all free will and the receipts, so play smart.
[Helaman 14:31] God hooked you up to tell good from bad so you can pick life or death; you do good, you get the glow-up back, do evil, and the bad vibes come right back atcha.
[Helaman 15:1] Yo, fam, listen up: if y'all don't repent, your homes are gonna be straight-up abandoned, no cap.
[Helaman 15:2] Deadass, if y'all don't repent, the women gonna be crying hard when they're nursing babies 'cause nobody can run or hide; pregnant folks gonna be stuck and crushed, left to perish...mad rough.
[Helaman 15:3] Yo, huge L on the Nephi crew if they don't repent after seeing all these signs; God picked them, loved them, and even threw some tough love their way 'cause He cares, no cap.
[Helaman 15:4] But real talk, God's not vibing with the Lamanites 'cause their deeds been sus nonstop, all 'cause their fam's bad habits; still, salvation's sliding in thanks to the Nephites' preaching, and God's keeping them around for that reason.
[Helaman 15:5] Low-key, most of them are on their duty grind, walking straight before God, sticking to His commandments and the Law of Moses like it's main character energy.
[Helaman 15:6] For real, most are grinding hard, hustling nonstop to share the truth with their squad, so their crew keeps leveling up daily with new believers.
[Helaman 15:7] Yo, you've seen it...when folks catch the truth, realize their fam's traditions are mad sus, and get woke to the holy scriptures and prophecies, they catch the faith drip and repent, turning their hearts around big time.
[Helaman 15:8] So yeah, everyone who got this glow-up is solid AF in faith and riding that freedom wave hard...you know the vibes.
[Helaman 15:9] And you know they straight-up ditched their weapons and low-key scared to pick 'em up 'cause sin's sus; they'd rather get stomped by enemies than swing swords...all 'cause their faith in Christ's got them on that peace flex.
[Helaman 15:10] So, since they're solid in what they believe and don't flop once they're woke, God's gonna bless them and keep them around longer, even with their screw-ups.
[Helaman 15:11] Bet, even if they dip into unbelief, God's still gonna keep them ticking till the time our ancestors and prophet Zenos hyped up...when the Lamanites get woke again to the truth.
[Helaman 15:12] No cap, in the end times, God's promises are stretched out to the Lamanites; even though they'll catch mad L's, get chased around the world, smacked down, and left homeless, God's mercy's still got them.
[Helaman 15:13] This checks with prophecy...they'll get woke again to the real deal, knowing their Redeemer and main shepherd, and rejoin His squad as true sheep.
[Helaman 15:14] So real talk, it'll be way L for y'all unless you hit that repentance grind...otherwise, the Lamanites are taking the W over you.
[Helaman 15:15] Facts: if the Lamanites had seen the same big flex miracles y'all did, they wouldn't have dipped into unbelief 'cause of old family drama...you can see that for yourselves, no cap.
[Helaman 15:16] So God says straight up: I ain't wiping them out for good, but when my timing's right, they'll slide back to me...say less.
[Helaman 15:17] Now listen, God says: if the Nephites don't hit that repentance and stop ignoring His will, He's gonna straight-up erase them...no cap...'cause they've been sus with unbelief despite all the epic miracles He pulled for them; and that's as sure as God's alive.
[Helaman 16:1] So, a bunch caught Samuel the Lamanite's preach on the city walls, and those who vibed with his word bounced to find Nephi; when they did, they owned up to their sins, no cap, and asked to get baptized for the Lord.
[Helaman 16:2] But the haters who didn't buy Samuel's words got mad and threw rocks and shot arrows at him on the wall...still, God's Spirit had his back so no stone or arrow even landed, no cap.
[Helaman 16:3] When they realized they couldn't land a hit on Samuel, way more peeps caught the vibe and dipped to Nephi for baptism, no cap.
[Helaman 16:4] Peep this: Nephi was out here baptizing, dropping prophecies, preaching hard, crying repentance, flexing signs and wonders, and pulling miracles so everyone knew Christ was about to make His grand entrance...say less.
[Helaman 16:5] He was spilling tea on stuff about to go down soon, so when it popped off, they'd be woke and remember they got the receipts upfront...so they'd believe; so everyone who vibed with Samuel's words rolled up to get baptized, coming clean and repenting.
[Helaman 16:6] Most still weren't buying Samuel's vibe; so when stones and arrows couldn't land, they told their captains, "Yo, this dude's got a demon or some, that's why we can't hit him...so cuff him and drag him off, ASAP."
[Helaman 16:7] When they moved to grab him, Samuel just yeeted off the wall and dipped straight back to his hometown, where he kept preaching and dropping prophecies to his own crew.
[Helaman 16:8] And yeah, Samuel ghosted the Nephites for good, and that's just how the people's story played out.
[Helaman 16:9] And that's a wrap on year 86 of the judges running the show over the Nephites...say less.
[Helaman 16:10] Year 87 closed out with most folks still flexing pride and sin, while just a few kept it low-key righteous in God's eyes...big mood.
[Helaman 16:11] Same energy ran through year 88 of the judges' reign...pride and wickedness mostly clutching the vibe, with just a few keeping it real before God.
[Helaman 16:12] Not much changed, except the people got even more sus with sin, doubling down on breaking God's commandments in year 89 of the judges' reign...big oof.
[Helaman 16:13] Then in year 90 of the judges, big signs and wonders popped off, and the prophets' words started hitting different...like, real talk, prophecy receipts incoming.
[Helaman 16:14] Angels showed up IRL to the wise dudes, dropping hype news of mad joy; and just like that, scriptures started leveling up in real-time that year.
[Helaman 16:15] Still, most people went full stubborn mode, except the real believers from both Nephites and Lamanites; they started flexing on their own smarts and muscle, saying:
[Helaman 16:16] They might've guessed a few things right outta all that noise, but come on, no cap...those epic miracles they talked about? Nah, can't be real.
[Helaman 16:17] Then they started throwing shade and debating hard, going back and forth like:
[Helaman 16:18] They argued it's straight-up sus that a Christ would show up; if he's the Son of God, OG of heaven and earth, why wouldn't he flex for us too, not just peeps in Jerusalem?
[Helaman 16:19] For real, why wouldn't he make a cameo here just like in Jerusalem? Sounds kinda sus.
[Helaman 16:20] Low-key, we know this whole "miracles gonna happen…just not here" story is sus AF, passed down by our dads to keep us blind...'cause we've never seen receipts ourselves, so they keep us in the dark.
[Helaman 16:21] They'll pull some slick, shady moves powered by the evil one's dark arts...big brain mysteries we can't even decode...keeping us locked as their word servants, 'cause we lean on them to school us; if we stay chill with that, they'll keep us clueless for life.
[Helaman 16:22] The people cooked up mad dumb ideas in their heads, got hella shook 'cause Satan kept hyping them to sin nonstop; he ran around flexing rumors and beef everywhere, just to make their hearts stone-cold against all the good vibes and legit stuff about to drop.
[Helaman 16:23] Even with all the wild signs and miracles popping off among God's people, Satan still snagged major clout over everyone's hearts across the whole land.
[Helaman 16:24] And that's a wrap on year ninety of the judges running the Nephi squad.
[Helaman 16:25] So yeah, that's the final chapter of Helaman's book, straight from him and his fam's records.
[3 Nephi 1:1] So, year ninety-one dipped, and we hit six hundred since Lehi bounced from Jerusalem; Lachoneus was flexing as chief judge and top boss of the land then.
[3 Nephi 1:2] Nephi, son of Helaman, dipped from Zarahemla, handing his oldest son Nephi the full task to guard the brass plates, all records, and sacred stuff kept since Lehi left Jerusalem...say less.
[3 Nephi 1:3] Then he bounced without a trace...no one knows where...and his son Nephi stayed on deck, holding down the records for the squad, no cap.
[3 Nephi 1:4] At the jump of year ninety-two, the prophets' predictions started flexing harder...bigger signs and crazier miracles popped off among the people, no cap.
[3 Nephi 1:5] But some folks started capping, saying Samuel the Lamanite's prophecies were past due and ain't gonna pop off.
[3 Nephi 1:6] They started flexing on their bros like, "Yo, time's up, Samuel's words didn't drop, so all your hype and faith on this? Straight-up L, wasted energy."
[3 Nephi 1:7] Chaos blew up everywhere; believers caught mad feels, low-key scared the prophecies might ghost and never come true.
[3 Nephi 1:8] Still, they kept their eyes glued, waiting on that day-and-night-but-it's-just-one-day vibe, just to prove their faith wasn't cap.
[3 Nephi 1:9] The haters set a deadline: anyone still vibing with those prophecies gets yeeted unless Samuel's promised sign drops for real.
[3 Nephi 1:10] When Nephi Jr. peeped how sus his people were being, his heart straight-up broke, mad sorrow hitting hard.
[3 Nephi 1:11] So Nephi dropped to the ground, full-on humble mode, screaming to God hard for his crew...especially those about to get wiped out just for holding onto their fam's traditions.
[3 Nephi 1:12] Nephi kept yelling at the Lord all day, no cap, then boom...the Lord's voice slid in, saying:
[3 Nephi 1:13] Heads up and vibes high; the moment's here...tonight the sign drops, and tomorrow I roll into the world to prove I'm all about fulfilling what my holy prophets said, no cap.
[3 Nephi 1:14] Yo, I'm pulling up to my people to lock down everything I've been dropping since day one, doing the will of both the Father and the Son...Father 'cause of me, and Son 'cause of my flesh. The time's now, and tonight the sign's gonna pop off.
[3 Nephi 1:15] Facts: Nephi's prophecy hit different...sunset came with zero darkness, and the people were shook 'cause night didn't do its usual blackout.
[3 Nephi 1:16] Tons of non-believers straight-up collapsed like dead, realizing their savage plan to wipe out the faithful was totally owned...Samuel's sign was legit and had just dropped.
[3 Nephi 1:17] Everyone finally caught on...the Son of God was about to flex in person; people everywhere, from west to east and north to south, were so shook they hit the floor.
[3 Nephi 1:18] They realized the prophets had been spilling receipts on this for ages, the sign was real, and suddenly they got mad scared 'cause their sins and doubt caught up with them.
[3 Nephi 1:19] No cap, that night stayed lit like mid-day, no darkness anywhere; sunrise came on time next day, and everyone knew for real...the Lord's birth day had arrived 'cause of the sign.
[3 Nephi 1:20] Bet...all of it went down exactly like the prophets said, no receipts needed.
[3 Nephi 1:21] Also, a fresh star popped up just like the word said it would.
[3 Nephi 1:22] From then on, Satan started spitting lies to harden folks' hearts, hoping they'd ghost the signs and wonders they peeped, but low-key most people stayed woke and turned up for the Lord anyway.
[3 Nephi 1:23] Nephi and a crew went all in, baptizing people to get that repentance glow-up with major sin wipeouts, and just like that, peace started flexing big time across the land.
[3 Nephi 1:24] No beef anywhere, except some folks trying to flex with scripture saying Moses' law was outdated...but they totally missed the vibe and messed up the whole script.
[3 Nephi 1:25] But they got woke fast, realizing they were dead wrong since the law ain't fulfilled yet...every single detail gotta drop, no cap; so that year, they owned up and said sorry for messing up.
[3 Nephi 1:26] So, year ninety-two slid by, dropping hype news on the people 'cause the signs played out exactly like all the holy prophets flexed.
[3 Nephi 1:27] Year ninety-three also cruised by peaceful, except for those Gadianton robbers camping on the mountains running wild; their hideouts were so sus and solid the people couldn't clap back, so they kept causing chaos and dropping mad bodies.
[3 Nephi 1:28] By year ninety-four, those Gadianton boys were growing like crazy, low-key 'cause a bunch of Nephite dissenters bounced to join them, and it hit hard on the Nephites still holding it down in the land.
[3 Nephi 1:29] The Lamanites were low-key stressed too, 'cause their kids grew up strong but got played by some slick Zoramites who used lies and mad smooth talk to pull them into the Gadianton robbers' crew.
[3 Nephi 1:30] So the Lamanites caught serious Ls too, losing faith and good vibes 'cause the new generation was straight-up wildin' with wickedness.
[3 Nephi 2:1] Year ninety-five dipped too, and people started ghosting those signs and wonders they once heard, getting numb and sus, hardening their hearts and going full-blind mode, straight up disbelieving all the receipts they had.
[3 Nephi 2:2] They started cooking up sus theories, thinking all the signs were just humans or the devil's stunt to trick folks; so Satan copped their hearts again, blinding their eyes and making them think Jesus' teachings were straight-up cringe and pointless.
[3 Nephi 2:3] The people started leveling up in sin and nasty vibes, doubting any more signs would drop; meanwhile, Satan was on a whole mission, snatching hearts and hyping them up to commit major evil moves across the land.
[3 Nephi 2:4] And just like that, years ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, and ninety-nine all slid past without much flex.
[3 Nephi 2:5] And boom, a full hundred years bounced since Mosiah was flexing as king over the Nephites.
[3 Nephi 2:6] It had been six hundred and nine years since Lehi dipped outta Jerusalem, no cap.
[3 Nephi 2:7] Nine years had slid by since the prophets dropped the tea about the sign that Christ was gonna show up in the world.
[3 Nephi 2:8] The Nephites started counting their years from when the sign dropped or Christ rolled in, so yeah, nine years had passed since then.
[3 Nephi 2:9] Nephi, the OG dad of Nephi holding the record-keeping bag, dipped and was straight-up MIA all over Zarahemla.
[3 Nephi 2:10] Even with tons of preaching and prophecy drops, the people stayed deep in wickedness, so years ten and eleven just ghosted by in full-on sin mode.
[3 Nephi 2:11] In year thirteen, wars and beef exploded everywhere 'cause the Gadianton robbers were popping off, slaughtering mad people, wrecking cities, and dropping chaos so hard that both Nephites and Lamanites had to squad up and fight back, no cap.
[3 Nephi 2:12] So all the Lamanites turned to the Lord squaded up with their Nephite fam, and for the safety of their lives, women, and kids, they had to grab weapons to clap back at the Gadianton robbers and flex on keeping their rights, church vibes, worship, freedom, and liberty intact.
[3 Nephi 2:13] Before year thirteen dipped, the Nephites were on the brink of total wipeout 'cause this war was straight-up savage, no lie.
[3 Nephi 2:14] The Lamanites who teamed up with the Nephites got counted right in with the Nephite crew, no cap.
[3 Nephi 2:15] Their curse got wiped, and their skin switched up to match the Nephites' white, no cap.
[3 Nephi 2:16] Their young kings and queens leveled up in looks, got counted as Nephites, and straight flexed that Nephite rep...thus closed out year thirteen.
[3 Nephi 2:17] At the jump of year fourteen, the war between the robbers and Nephi's squad was still nasty, but the Nephites snagged some W's, pushing the robbers back into the mountains and their shady hideouts.
[3 Nephi 2:18] Year fourteen wrapped, but come year fifteen, the robbers popped off again, and cause the Nephites were acting mad sus with all their beef and drama, the Gadianton gang snatched plenty Ws over them.
[3 Nephi 2:19] Year fifteen closed out with the people drowning in mad struggles, the sword of destruction hovering like a shadow, ready to knock 'em out, all 'cause of their own mess.
[3 Nephi 3:1] So, in year sixteen since Christ showed up, Lachoneus, the big boss governor, got a savage letter from the leader of that robber crew, and this is what they said:
[3 Nephi 3:2] Lachoneus, top-tier governor, I'm sliding this letter with mad respect for how solid you and your crew stay holding down what you think is your right and freedom; fr, y'all stand like God's got your back defending your liberty, property, and your so-called country.
[3 Nephi 3:3] Low-key, Lachoneus, it's kinda wild you're out here thinking you can flex against my squad of fearless warriors who're strapped and hyped, just waiting on the green light to roll up on the Nephites and wreck 'em.
[3 Nephi 3:4] I know their vibe's untouchable, tested them in battle, and see how deep their hate runs for you 'cause of all your wrongs...so if they roll up on you, it'd be total destruction, no cap.
[3 Nephi 3:5] So I penned this letter, sealed with my own hand, low-key caring about your well-being 'cause you stay solid on what you think is right and show real noble energy on the battlefield.
[3 Nephi 3:6] So I'm sliding you this message hoping you'll just hand over your cities, lands, and stuff to my crew instead of catching the L that comes with the sword and total destruction.
[3 Nephi 3:7] Or, real talk, just roll with us, get clued in on our secret moves, and be our fam...not slaves, but brothers sharing everything we got.
[3 Nephi 3:8] Bet, I swear if you do this, no cap, you won't get wiped out; but if you ghost this, I swear on everything, next month my armies roll in, won't hold back, and they'll slay you till you're straight extinct.
[3 Nephi 3:9] Yo, I'm Giddianhi, running the secret Gadianton squad; I know our moves are solid, OG as hell, passed down through the ages.
[3 Nephi 3:10] I'm shooting this letter to you, Lachoneus, hoping you'll just hand over your lands and stuff blood-free, so my people can get back their rights after you snatched 'em for being petty; if not, I'm coming for revenge. I'm Giddianhi.
[3 Nephi 3:11] When Lachoneus got this savage letter, he was shook at Giddianhi's nerve demanding Nephite land and threatening the people...especially since those folks didn't get wronged by anyone but themselves for ditching to join those sus assassin robbers.
[3 Nephi 3:12] Lachoneus, the governor, was legit and not about to trip over a robber's threats; so he ignored Giddianhi's letter and had his people hit up the Lord for backup before the robbers showed up.
[3 Nephi 3:13] Yeah, he sent the word out for everyone to squad up with their women, kids, animals, and all their stuff...except their land...in one spot, no cap.
[3 Nephi 3:14] He had mad strong forts built all around, flexing serious defense, and put armies of Nephites and loyal Lamanites on watch 24/7 to keep those robbers on lock.
[3 Nephi 3:15] He told them straight: As the Lord lives, if you don't ditch your sins and pray up, you're gonna get roasted by those Gadianton robbers, no cap.
[3 Nephi 3:16] Lachoneus dropped such fire prophecies that everybody got shook and leveled up, grinding hard to follow his words.
[3 Nephi 3:17] Lachoneus put top captains in charge of all Nephite armies, ready to boss up when the robbers roll out the wilderness to attack.
[3 Nephi 3:18] The GOAT of all captains and boss of the Nephite armies got named...Gidgiddoni, no contest.
[3 Nephi 3:19] Usually, Nephites pick their top captains with mad prophecy and revelation skills...unless they're slacking...and Gidgiddoni was that big-time prophet, just like the chief judge.
[3 Nephi 3:20] The people told Gidgiddoni: Pray up to the Lord, then let's roll into the mountains and wilderness to catch these robbers slipping and wipe them out on their turf.
[3 Nephi 3:21] Gidgiddoni was like, nah fam, if we chase them, the Lord might let us get clapped; instead, we're gonna hold it down in our turf, squad up all armies, and wait for them to come...we'll clap back then, no cap, as the Lord lives.
[3 Nephi 3:22] By year seventeen's end, Lachoneus's call spread everywhere; folks packed up their horses, chariots, cattle, flocks, grain, and all their drip, rolling out in tens of thousands to the spot set for squad defense against the haters.
[3 Nephi 3:23] The chosen spot was Zarahemla and the area between Zarahemla and Bountiful, straight up to the border between Bountiful and Desolation...no cap.
[3 Nephi 3:24] Tons of Nephites pulled up and gathered in this land, but Lachoneus made sure they camped south 'cause the north was straight cursed, no cap.
[3 Nephi 3:25] They beefed up defenses, vibed as one squad, low-key shook by Lachoneus's words, bounced their sins, and prayed hard to the Lord to save them when the haters showed up for battle.
[3 Nephi 3:26] They were mad stressed about the enemies, so Gidgiddoni made sure they crafted all kinds of war gear...armor, shields, bucklers...straight up following his playbook.
[3 Nephi 4:1] By the end of year eighteen, the robber armies got battle-ready, rolling down from hills, mountains, wilderness, hideouts, and secret spots, snagging lands north and south, grabbing all the Nephite ghost towns and abandoned cities.
[3 Nephi 4:2] But real talk, those ghost lands had zero wild beasts or game left...robbers could only find animals way out in the wilderness.
[3 Nephi 4:3] The robbers couldn't survive outside the wilderness 'cause food was deadass scarce; Nephites ghosted the lands, took their flocks, herds, and all their stuff, and stuck together like a solid squad.
[3 Nephi 4:4] So the robbers had zero chance to snag food unless they went full frontal on the Nephites, who were squad deep, stocked with provisions, horses, cattle, flocks to last seven years, aiming to wipe out the robbers...thus, year eighteen slid past.
[3 Nephi 4:5] Come year nineteen, Giddianhi realized he had no choice but to throw hands at the Nephites...no food, no survival unless they went full plunder, robbery, and murder mode.
[3 Nephi 4:6] They were too scared to spread out and farm 'cause Nephites would catch and clap back, so Giddianhi ordered his crew to go all-in battle mode this year against the Nephites.
[3 Nephi 4:7] So they rolled up for battle in the sixth month, and fr, the day was brutal; Giddianhi's army flexed that robbers' fit...lamb-skin waists, blood-drenched, shaved heads, with head-plates on deck...straight scary vibes with their armor and bloody drip.
[3 Nephi 4:8] When the Nephite armies peeped Giddianhi's savage look, they all dropped to the ground, screaming prayers to God to spare them and snatch them outta enemy hands.
[3 Nephi 4:9] When Giddianhi's squad saw the Nephite armies drop and pray, they shouted loud AF, thinking the Nephites were shook and totally scared of their savage flex.
[3 Nephi 4:10] But nah, they got played ... the Nephites weren't shook by them, just reverent AF to God, begging for backup; so when Giddianhi's army charged, the Nephites were locked and loaded, powered up by the Lord's strength.
[3 Nephi 4:11] The fight kicked off in the sixth month, and damn, it was savage...more brutal slaughter than anyone from Lehi's crew had seen since bouncing from Jerusalem, no cap.
[3 Nephi 4:12] Even with all Giddianhi's hype and threats, the Nephites flexed hard and clapped back, forcing his squad to dip and retreat.
[3 Nephi 4:13] Gidgiddoni told his troops to chase those losers all the way to the wilderness edge, no mercy for anyone caught slippin', and they clapped 'em hard until the job was fully done.
[3 Nephi 4:14] Giddianhi, who fought mad bold, tried to bail but got chased down, worn out from all the clapping, and was straight-up popped...end of Giddianhi the robber.
[3 Nephi 4:15] The Nephite squads bounced back to their safe spot, and year nineteen dipped with no more robber battles...and year twenty stayed quiet too, no cap.
[3 Nephi 4:16] In year twenty-one, no straight-up battle, but the robbers tried to box in the Nephites from all sides, thinking if they trapped them and cut off their perks, the Nephites'd just quit and give up on their terms.
[3 Nephi 4:17] They picked a new boss named Zemnarihah, and he's the one who masterminded this whole siege vibe.
[3 Nephi 4:18] But low-key, this backfired on the robbers since the Nephites had mad supplies stashed, making it impossible for the siege to actually do damage.
[3 Nephi 4:19] Meanwhile, the robbers were straight-up struggling with scraps...only had wild meat to survive off in the wilderness, no steady food supply.
[3 Nephi 4:20] Then the wild game ran out in the wilderness, and the robbers were legit about to starve out, no cap.
[3 Nephi 4:21] The Nephites kept hitting the robbers 24/7, dropping their squads by thousands and tens of thousands, no chill.
[3 Nephi 4:22] So Zemnarihah's crew low-key wanted to bail on their plan 'cause they were getting wrecked nonstop, night and day.
[3 Nephi 4:23] Then Zemnarihah ordered his squad to dip from the siege and bounce all the way up north to the farthest lands.
[3 Nephi 4:24] Gidgiddoni caught their move, knowing they were weak from hunger and mass L's, so he sent his armies at night to block their retreat, straight-up camping their exit.
[3 Nephi 4:25] They pulled this stunt overnight, moving past the robbers, so next day when robbers rolled out, Nephite armies boxed them in front and back...full-on trap.
[3 Nephi 4:26] Even the robbers chillin' in the south got blocked at their hideouts...props to Gidgiddoni for running the whole play.
[3 Nephi 4:27] Tons of robbers just tapped out and surrendered to the Nephites, while the rest got straight-up smoked.
[3 Nephi 4:28] Zemnarihah, the main dude, got caught and was swung up top a tree till he died; then they chopped the tree down, yelling loud like it was the final mic drop.
[3 Nephi 4:29] Pray the Lord keeps His people woke and pure so they can knock down anyone trying to flex with power and shady plots, just like this dude got taken down.
[3 Nephi 4:30] They all hyped up and shouted in unison: May the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob keep this squad righteous and safe whenever they holler for Him.
[3 Nephi 4:31] Everyone broke out singing loud as one, flexing mad praise to God for saving them from getting caught by their enemies.
[3 Nephi 4:32] They straight-up yelled: Hosanna to the Most High God, and hyped up the name of the Lord God Almighty, the ultimate boss.
[3 Nephi 4:33] Their hearts were full AF, tears streaming 'cause God's goodness saved them from their foes; they knew it was their humble repentance that dodged eternal wreckage.
[3 Nephi 5:1] No one in the Nephite crew doubted a single word from the holy prophets...everyone low-key knew all their words had to come true, no cap.
[3 Nephi 5:2] They were all about that Christ arrival vibe since the signs matched the prophets' tea, and with stuff already unfolding, they knew everything was gonna go down exactly as spoken, no receipts needed.
[3 Nephi 5:3] So they ghosted all their sins, gross habits, and sketchy moves, grinding hard to serve God 24/7 with main-character energy.
[3 Nephi 5:4] After snagging all the robbers...no cap, none slipped past unless they got clapped...they locked them up, dropped the God word on 'em, and anyone who repented and promised to quit the murder flex got free pass.
[3 Nephi 5:5] But anyone who ghosted the covenant and still low-key plotted secret murders or threw threats at their own squad got caught and hit with the law's full clapback.
[3 Nephi 5:6] They straight-up shut down all those sus, sneaky, and gross combos where mad evil and murders went down.
[3 Nephi 5:7] So, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, and twenty-five years slid by...straight-up twenty-five years gone like that.
[3 Nephi 5:8] A ton of wild and epic stuff went down that'd blow some minds, but no cap, this book can't hold even a fraction of what happened with all those people in twenty-five years.
[3 Nephi 5:9] But yo, receipts exist...records with all the tea on this crew; Nephi dropped a shorter but legit version too, say less.
[3 Nephi 5:10] So I put together my record based on Nephi's OG plates...the plates straight-up named after him.
[3 Nephi 5:11] Low-key, I'm engraving this record on plates I crafted myself, no outsourcing vibes.
[3 Nephi 5:12] So yeah, they call me Mormon...named after the land where Alma first kicked off the church after everyone went sus with their transgressions.
[3 Nephi 5:13] Straight up, I'm a disciple of Jesus Christ, God's Son, called by Him to flex His word to the squad so they can cop eternal life, no cap.
[3 Nephi 5:14] So like, God's will made it obvious I gotta record these deeds to answer the prayers of the OG holy ones who dipped, based on their faith...say less.
[3 Nephi 5:15] Yeah, this is just a short recap of everything popping off from when Lehi bounced Jerusalem up to now.
[3 Nephi 5:16] So, I'm compiling my record based on what the homies before me said up till my own time started, bet.
[3 Nephi 5:17] Then I flex a record of the stuff my own eyes caught firsthand, no cap.
[3 Nephi 5:18] I'm sure my record is straight-up real and fair, but fr, some things just can't be put into words with our language, low-key.
[3 Nephi 5:19] Aight, I'm done with my own rant, now sliding into the receipts of what went down before me, say less.
[3 Nephi 5:20] I'm Mormon, straight blood from Lehi's line, big ups to God and Savior Jesus for pulling our ancestors outta Jerusalem...only He and the squad knew...and blessing us with mad knowledge to save our souls, no cap.
[3 Nephi 5:21] No doubt, He's been flexing blessings on Jacob's fam and showing mad mercy to Joseph's crew.
[3 Nephi 5:22] For real, as long as Lehi's kids stayed woke and kept His commandments, He's been blessing and leveling them up just like He said.
[3 Nephi 5:23] Bet, He's gonna pull a squad of Joseph's fam back into knowing the Lord their God, no doubt.
[3 Nephi 5:24] Deadass, as long as the Lord's alive, He's gonna squad up every last Jacobite remnant scattered all over the globe, no cap.
[3 Nephi 5:25] For real, just like He promised Jacob's whole house, that covenant's gonna pop off on His schedule, bringing all Jacob's crew back to the realness of what He promised.
[3 Nephi 5:26] Then they'll peep their Redeemer...Jesus Christ, God's Son...and get scooped up from all corners of the earth back to their homelands, no cap, for real as the Lord lives. Amen.
[3 Nephi 6:1] So, by year 26, the Nephites all bounced back to their lands, squad and all, with their fam, flocks, horses, cattle...everything they owned, no cap.
[3 Nephi 6:2] Since they didn't finish all their supplies, they packed up the leftovers...grain, gold, silver, all the valuables...and dipped back to their spots up north and down south, taking their stuff with them.
[3 Nephi 6:3] They low-key gave the robbers who made a peace deal and wanted to stick as Lamanites some lands based on their squad size, so they could hustle and survive...peace vibes spread everywhere, no cap.
[3 Nephi 6:4] They started glowin' up again, year 26 and 27 slid by, the land was mad orderly, and their laws were straight-up fair and just, no cap.
[3 Nephi 6:5] Real talk, nothing was blocking the squad from leveling up nonstop...unless they dipped into sin and messed up.
[3 Nephi 6:6] Big shoutout to Gidgiddoni, Judge Lachoneus, and their crew of leaders who locked in that major peace across the land, no cap.
[3 Nephi 6:7] They went hard rebuilding mad cities from scratch and fixing up the OG ones, low-key flexing on the restoration game.
[3 Nephi 6:8] They built hella highways and roads connecting city to city, land to land, and spot to spot...straight up leveling the travel glow-up.
[3 Nephi 6:9] Year 28 dipped by smooth, and the people stayed on that peace flex nonstop, no cap.
[3 Nephi 6:10] Then year 29 hit and the squad started beefin'; some got mad pride flex over their crazy riches, going full-on savage with persecutions, no lie.
[3 Nephi 6:11] Lots of merchants, lawyers, and officers were running the scene in the land...big biz and law vibes everywhere.
[3 Nephi 6:12] The peeps started flexing status based on their bank and access to knowledge; some stayed clueless 'cause they were broke, while the rich got mad brain gains, no cap.
[3 Nephi 6:13] Some caught major pride vibes, others stayed mad humble; some clapped back when dissed, but others took all the shade and hate without throwing hands back, keeping humble and sorry before God, say less.
[3 Nephi 6:14] So inequality blew up everywhere, tearing the church apart by year 30...only a few converted Lamanites stayed loyal, holding that true faith tight, unshaken and grinding hard to keep God's commandments, no cap.
[3 Nephi 6:15] The real plug behind all this mess? Satan flexing hard, hyping people to cop all kinds of sins, blowing up their pride, making them chase power, clout, cash, and all that fake flex, no cap.
[3 Nephi 6:16] So Satan straight-up hijacked their hearts, pushing nonstop sin, which is why peace only lasted a hot minute, no cap.
[3 Nephi 6:17] So, at the jump of year 30, people had been vibing with the devil's temptations for ages, getting dragged everywhere he wanted and doing all the dirty deeds he wished...straight-up peak wickedness mode.
[3 Nephi 6:18] They weren't clueless about their sins...they knew God's plan 'cause they'd been schooled...so they straight-up chose to rebel on purpose, no excuses.
[3 Nephi 6:19] Now it was the days of Lachoneus Jr., who took over his dad's spot and ran the squad that year, no cap.
[3 Nephi 6:20] Then heavenly-inspired peeps popped up everywhere, standing tall, preaching hard about the squad's sins and dropping receipts on Christ's resurrection, death, and sufferings like straight-up gospel rizz.
[3 Nephi 6:21] Tons of people got mad salty at the ones preaching this truth...especially the chief judges, high priests, and lawyers; no cap, all the legal eagles were heated about the testimonies.
[3 Nephi 6:22] No lawyer, judge, or high priest could flex death sentences without the governor's signature backing the move, say less.
[3 Nephi 6:23] Many bold witnesses for Christ got snatched and lowkey killed by judges, so the governor only got the tea after it was too late.
[3 Nephi 6:24] But fr, this was straight-up against the law...no one could get the death sentence without the governor's green light.
[3 Nephi 6:25] So, the word got to Zarahemla, and the governor caught receipts on these judges who illegally iced the Lord's prophets, breaking the law big time.
[3 Nephi 6:26] Then they got hauled before a judge to face the music for their crimes, all based on the laws the people set down...no cap.
[3 Nephi 6:27] Turns out those judges had a squad...friends, fam, and nearly all the lawyers and high priests teamed up with their crew to back them up before the trial.
[3 Nephi 6:28] They made a shady pact, like OG devil-approved collab, teaming up to flex against all things righteous...mad sus energy.
[3 Nephi 6:29] So they squad up to clown on the Lord's people, promising to wipe them out and slip murderers past justice, which was about to drop hard under the law.
[3 Nephi 6:30] They straight-up dissed the law and their country's rights, plotting to take down the governor and crown a king, killing freedom vibes so the land would bow to royalty instead.
[3 Nephi 7:1] Hold up, they didn't crown a king; instead, in year thirty, they clapped the chief judge's seat by straight-up offing him...brutal move.
[3 Nephi 7:2] The squad split up, dividing into tribes by fam and friends, lowkey tearing down the whole government setup.
[3 Nephi 7:3] Each tribe flexed by picking their own chief, turning into squads with leaders running the show.
[3 Nephi 7:4] Real talk, no one was solo...everyone rolled deep with mad family, kindreds, and friends, so these tribes blew up big time.
[3 Nephi 7:5] So yeah, no wars yet, but all this mess hit 'cause they low-key handed the keys to Satan and let the darkness vibe take over.
[3 Nephi 7:6] The government rules got wrecked thanks to the low-key alliance of the friends and fam of the prophet killers...big sus conspiracy move.
[3 Nephi 7:7] They stirred mad drama so hard that even the mostly good folks went dark, leaving only a scarce few still rocking that righteous energy.
[3 Nephi 7:8] Not even six years in, most peeps bounced from being righteous, acting like a dog back to its own throw-up or a pig chillin' in the mud...straight-up nasty relapses.
[3 Nephi 7:9] This sneaky squad that dragged the crew into mad sin linked up and put a dude named Jacob as their main plug.
[3 Nephi 7:10] They crowned Jacob king of their shady crew, and he was top-tier in trash-talking the prophets hyping Jesus...big L energy.
[3 Nephi 7:11] So, these sketchy folks had fewer numbers than the tribes who were mostly squad goals, even if their leaders ran different laws per tribe; still, everyone was salty and teamed up hating the ones sworn to wreck the government.
[3 Nephi 7:12] Jacob peeped that the enemy squad had the numbers, so as king, he ordered his crew to bounce north, build their own kingdom, and flex like they'd get mad defectors joining up...he hyped it hard...and they played the game right.
[3 Nephi 7:13] They moved so fast no one could block them till they dipped outta the people's reach; that wrapped up year thirty and the Nephi crew's saga for real.
[3 Nephi 7:14] In year thirty-one, they split into tribes by fam and friends, agreeing to no beef wars, but laws and gov were all over the place 'cause chiefs ran their own shows; still, they set tight rules to keep tribes from beefing, so sorta peace was a thing...but low-key their hearts dipped from God, stoning prophets and kicking them out like total clout chasers.
[3 Nephi 7:15] Nephi, who'd gotten visits from angels and the Lord's voice, straight-up saw the angels IRL and got the plug on Christ's ministry, also peeped how fast folks bounced back from good vibes to total wickedness and nasty abominations.
[3 Nephi 7:16] So, feeling heavy over their stubborn hearts and blind minds, Nephi rolled up that same year preaching loud and clear: repent and get your sins wiped by trusting in Jesus Christ.
[3 Nephi 7:17] Nephi dropped mad knowledge on them...too much to even jot down, and half wouldn't do it justice...so it's not all in this book; but trust, he ministered with serious power and boss-level authority.
[3 Nephi 7:18] They got salty at Nephi 'cause his power was next level; they couldn't even doubt his words since his faith in Jesus was so strong angels were sliding through daily.
[3 Nephi 7:19] Flexing big time in Jesus' name, Nephi kicked out devils and nasty spirits, and even pulled his brother back from the dead after the squad stoned him to death.
[3 Nephi 7:20] The crowd saw the receipts and got heated over his power, but Nephi kept hitting them with mad miracles in Jesus' name, front and center.
[3 Nephi 7:21] Year thirty-one wrapped up with only a handful really switching lanes to the Lord, but those who did flexed hard, dropping receipts that God's power and Spirit in Jesus had straight-up visited them.
[3 Nephi 7:22] Anyone who got devils yeeted and healed from their sickness flexed big time, showing the whole squad how the Spirit of God worked through them...they even pulled off some signs and miracles right in front of everyone.
[3 Nephi 7:23] Year thirty-two bounced, and at the jump of thirty-three, Nephi was back yelling at the crowd to repent and get their sins wiped clean.
[3 Nephi 7:24] Real talk, no one hit that true repentance flex without getting dunked in water first...baptism's the move, no cap.
[3 Nephi 7:25] So Nephi put some dudes on the ministry squad to dunk everyone who rolled up, making it official with God and the crowd that they'd repented and got their sins wiped clean.
[3 Nephi 7:26] At the start of the year, plenty got baptized to show they were serious about repentance, and most of the year just slid by like that.
[3 Nephi 8:1] So like, our record's legit...kept by a straight-up righteous dude who pulled mad miracles in Jesus' name; no one could flex miracles unless they were spotless from all their dirt.
[3 Nephi 8:2] If this dude didn't mess up the timing, then yeah, year thirty-three was officially over, no cap.
[3 Nephi 8:3] The crowd was low-key hyped, waiting hard for that sign Samuel the Lamanite dropped...three days of straight-up darkness covering the whole land, no joke.
[3 Nephi 8:4] Even with all the receipts, people started catching major doubts and throwing shade, buzzing with arguments left and right.
[3 Nephi 8:5] So, year thirty-four, month one, day four, a mega storm popped off...like nothing this land had ever seen before, no cap.
[3 Nephi 8:6] Then came a savage tempest with thunder so loud it shook the whole earth like it was about to split legit in half.
[3 Nephi 8:7] Lightning was straight-up savage and sharper than anything this land had ever caught before.
[3 Nephi 8:8] Zarahemla city legit caught fire, no chill at all.
[3 Nephi 8:9] Moroni straight-up vanished, sinking deep into the sea, and everyone living there got drowned, no cap.
[3 Nephi 8:10] Earth literally lifted up and crushed Moronihah, turning that city spot into a massive mountain, not even joking.
[3 Nephi 8:11] The southern lands got hit with some next-level wreckage, straight-up mad destruction everywhere.
[3 Nephi 8:12] Yo, the north side got slammed even harder...whole land flipped upside down from tempest, whirlwinds, thunder, lightning, and earth shaking like it was throwing a tantrum.
[3 Nephi 8:13] The roads got wrecked...highways busted, easy streets turned trash, and all the smooth spots got mad rough outta nowhere.
[3 Nephi 8:14] Tons of big cities straight-up sank, others burned down, some got shook so hard their buildings crashed, people died, and the spots went full ghost town, no cap.
[3 Nephi 8:15] A few cities stuck around, but the wreckage was mad heavy and lots of people didn't make it, facts.
[3 Nephi 8:16] Some got snatched up by the whirlwind and bounced, no one knows where they dipped to, only that they vanished.
[3 Nephi 8:17] So yeah, the whole earth got twisted up and sus-looking thanks to the storms, thunder, lightning, and earth shaking like a bad flex gone wrong.
[3 Nephi 8:18] Peep this: rocks snapped in half everywhere, scattered in chunks, cracks, and seams all over the land like some crazy puzzle gone wild.
[3 Nephi 8:19] So, after like three hours...or maybe longer if you ask some...of nonstop thunder, lightning, storms, tempests, and earth-shaking chaos, everything finally chilled out, but then darkness dropped over the whole land, no cap.
[3 Nephi 8:20] Then thick darkness smothered the whole land so bad that everyone still alive could literally feel the vibes of the dark mist creeping on them.
[3 Nephi 8:21] No light anywhere, not even candles or torches could glow up, and their dry wood wouldn't catch fire, so everything stayed pitch black, zero brightness at all.
[3 Nephi 8:22] No fire, no glow, sun, moon, or stars...nothing to flex light-wise...because the dark mists had the whole land on permanent blackout mode, no cap.
[3 Nephi 8:23] The blackout lasted three whole days straight, and everyone was lowkey losing it...nonstop crying, yelling, and groaning over the darkness and the mad destruction that hit them hard.
[3 Nephi 8:24] Somewhere, folks were straight-up sobbing, like "Dang, if only we'd repented before this savage day, our fam would've been saved and not roasted in Zarahemla's big fire, fr."
[3 Nephi 8:25] Elsewhere, people were moaning, "Man, if we'd repented before this brutal day and stopped killing and stoning the prophets and throwing them out, our moms, daughters, and kids would've made it and not been buried under Moronihah's ruins." The crying was straight-up savage.
[3 Nephi 9:1] Suddenly, a voice blasted across the whole land, heard by everyone alive, straight-up crying out.
[3 Nephi 9:2] Yo, major woah to everyone on earth who won't repent...devil and his squad are low-key hyped, flexing hard over the fallen innocent of my peeps 'cause of all the messed-up stuff they did.
[3 Nephi 9:3] Heads up, I straight-up torched the huge city Zarahemla and everyone living there, no cap.
[3 Nephi 9:4] Also, I made the massive city Moroni sink deep underwater, and everyone inside got drowned...no survivors, fr.
[3 Nephi 9:5] I straight-up buried the big city Moronihah and its people under dirt to cover their sins and evil deeds, so the blood of prophets and saints won't be screaming at me no more about them.
[3 Nephi 9:6] And yo, I sank the city of Gilgal, burying everyone in the deep dirt underground, no cap.
[3 Nephi 9:7] No cap, I wiped out Onihah, Mocum, and Jerusalem...whole cities and their people...and flooded them to hide their wickedness, so the blood of prophets and saints won't be calling me out anymore.
[3 Nephi 9:8] Look, I sunk Gadiandi, Gadiomnah, Jacob, and Gimgimno, turning their spots into hills and valleys, burying all the people deep underground to hide their nasty deeds so the blood of prophets and saints stops dragging me for them.
[3 Nephi 9:9] Straight up, I torched the huge city Jacobugath, home to king Jacob's crew, 'cause their sins were next-level...secret murders, shady combos...they wrecked my people's peace and the whole government, so I wiped them out to silence the blood of prophets and saints calling me out.
[3 Nephi 9:10] No cap, I straight-up burned down Laman, Josh, Gad, and Kishkumen with all their people 'cause they were throwing out my prophets and stoning the ones I sent to call out their wickedness and messed-up deeds.
[3 Nephi 9:11] Since they kicked out all the prophets and had zero righteous vibes, I dropped fire and wiped them out to hide their sin from me, so the blood of my saints and prophets wouldn't scream at me from the dirt.
[3 Nephi 9:12] I've legit unleashed mad destruction on this land and its people all because of their savage wickedness and abominations, no cap.
[3 Nephi 9:13] Yo, if you're still standing 'cause you flexed more righteousness than them, won't you hit me up, repent, and switch lanes so I can fix you up?
[3 Nephi 9:14] For real, if you roll up to me, eternal life's on deck. My mercy's reaching out like a vibe check...anyone who shows gets that W. Blessed are the ones who pull up.
[3 Nephi 9:15] Look, I'm Jesus Christ, God's Son, the OG creator of heaven, earth, and everything in the mix. I've been with the Father since day one, we're tight...Father's flexin' His name through me.
[3 Nephi 9:16] I rolled up to my own people, but they ghosted me hard. All those scriptures about my arrival? Yeah, they just got that checkmark.
[3 Nephi 9:17] Whoever vibes with me gets promoted to God's squad, and I'll do the same for anyone who trusts my name...redemption rolls through me, and I'm the ultimate flex that finishes the law of Moses.
[3 Nephi 9:18] I'm the light and the life that runs this world, the Alpha and Omega ... the ultimate start and finish, no cap.
[3 Nephi 9:19] Yo, stop with all the blood sacrifices and burnt offerings...I'm over that. I won't even accept those old-school gifts anymore, say less.
[3 Nephi 9:20] Instead of blood, bring me a broken heart and a humble spirit. Anyone who pulls up like that? I'll dunk them in fire and the Holy Ghost...just like the Lamanites did back when they switched up on me, even if they didn't realize it then.
[3 Nephi 9:21] Look, I showed up to this world to snag redemption and save it straight from sin's clutches, no cap.
[3 Nephi 9:22] So if you repent and roll up to me with that childlike vibe, I got you...God's kingdom is all about those folks. I even flexed by laying down my life and picking it back up, so repent and come through, no matter where you at, and get saved.
[3 Nephi 10:1] So yeah, everyone around caught these words and witnessed the whole scene, then the whole vibe went silent for mad hours...straight silence.
[3 Nephi 10:2] People were so shook they stopped all that crying and wailing over their lost fam...silence took over the whole land for hours on end.
[3 Nephi 10:3] Then the voice popped back up for the crowd, and everyone heard and got receipts, saying:
[3 Nephi 10:4] Yo, people from these big cities that got wrecked, descendants of Jacob and the house of Israel, I've gathered you like a hen rounding up her chicks and fed you up good, no cap.
[3 Nephi 10:5] Low-key, I kept trying to gather you like a hen with her chicks, people of Israel who fell hard...even you in Jerusalem...but y'all ghosted every time, no cap.
[3 Nephi 10:6] Yo, house of Israel I still spared, I'm ready to gather you like a hen with her chicks anytime you repent and come back to me with 100% heart, say less.
[3 Nephi 10:7] But if you ghost me, house of Israel, your homes will turn to ghost towns until the covenant with your fam gets fulfilled, no cap.
[3 Nephi 10:8] After soaking in those words, the people started crying and howling again, mad over the loss of their kin and friends, no lie.
[3 Nephi 10:9] So those three days slid by, then morning hit, the darkness dipped off the land, the earth chilled out...no more shaking, rocks stopped breaking, the scary groans and wild noise all bounced.
[3 Nephi 10:10] The earth snapped back together and stood strong; the survivors' crying and mourning stopped...turned into straight-up joy and mad praise for the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.
[3 Nephi 10:11] Yo, up to this point, all the prophet's scriptures got fully checked off, no cap.
[3 Nephi 10:12] The real righteous squad got saved...they were the ones who actually listened to the prophets and didn't stone them or spill the saints' blood, so they got spared, bet.
[3 Nephi 10:13] They dodged getting buried alive, drowned, burned, smashed, swept away by storms, or smoked out in darkness...straight-up unbothered, no cap.
[3 Nephi 10:14] Yo, if you're reading this, get the vibe: anyone with the scriptures, flex your brain and check if all these death and destruction scenes...fire, smoke, storms, whirlwinds, earth opening up...don't line up with the prophecies from the holy prophets, bet.
[3 Nephi 10:15] Look, straight up, tons testified about Christ's arrival and got clapped for their receipts...no cap.
[3 Nephi 10:16] For real, prophets Zenos and Zenock both dropped receipts about this, especially calling out us...the leftover crew from their seed.
[3 Nephi 10:17] Yo, our dad Jacob also hyped a remnant from Joseph's line. So, aren't we that squad? And ain't all this proof on the brass plates Lehi snagged from Jerusalem? Say less.
[3 Nephi 10:18] By the end of year thirty-four, watch...Nephi's survivors and the spared Lamanites got mad blessings hooked up, so soon after Christ bounced to heaven, He straight-up showed Himself to them.
[3 Nephi 10:19] He flexed His body to them, served them up real, and the full tea on His ministry's coming later. For now, I'm wrapping my spiel.
[3 Nephi 11:1] So, a massive crowd of Nephi peeps rolled up by the temple in Bountiful, all shook and vibing off each other, flexing about the wild glow-up that just went down.
[3 Nephi 11:2] They were low-key chatting about Jesus Christ...the dude the sign warned them about, dead no cap.
[3 Nephi 11:3] While they were vibing in convo, a voice dropped from heaven...not loud or harsh, just low-key...but it hit deep, shook their whole bodies, pierced their souls, and set their hearts on fire, no cap.
[3 Nephi 11:4] Then boom, the voice came again, but they still didn't catch the vibe.
[3 Nephi 11:5] Third time's the charm...they heard the voice, actually tuned in, eyes glued up to heaven where the sound dropped.
[3 Nephi 11:6] And on that third hit, they finally caught the vibe of the voice, and it straight-up said to them:
[3 Nephi 11:7] Yo, peep my Beloved Son...I'm mad pleased with Him, I've flexed my name through Him...y'all better listen up.
[3 Nephi 11:8] As soon as they caught the meaning, they looked up and saw a Man rolling down from heaven, draped in white robes, standing right in their middle; the whole squad locked eyes on Him, too shook to even speak, thinking it was an angel showing up IRL.
[3 Nephi 11:9] Then He shot out His hand and dropped words on the crowd, saying:
[3 Nephi 11:10] Look, it's me, Jesus Christ...the one the prophets flexed about, saying I'd show up in the world.
[3 Nephi 11:11] Yo, I'm the light and life of the world; I downed that bitter cup the Father handed me and flexed His glory by soaking up the world's sins...I've been riding His wave since day one, no cap.
[3 Nephi 11:12] When Jesus dropped those words, the whole crowd hit the ground...remembering the prophecy that Christ would show up after ascending to heaven, straight up main-character energy.
[3 Nephi 11:13] Then the Lord spoke up to them, saying:
[3 Nephi 11:14] Get up and step to me, put your hands in my side and check the nail marks in my hands and feet, so you know for real I'm the God of Israel and the whole earth, slain for the world's sins, no cap.
[3 Nephi 11:15] So the whole squad rolled up, one by one, sliding their hands into His side, feeling the nail scars in His hands and feet; they all saw, touched, and straight-up confirmed with receipts that He's the one the prophets hyped to come.
[3 Nephi 11:16] After everyone had their moment and saw the truth for themselves, they all shouted together, no cap, saying:
[3 Nephi 11:17] Hosanna! Big ups to the Most High God's name! Then they all dropped to their knees at Jesus' feet, showing mad worship vibes.
[3 Nephi 11:18] Then He called out to Nephi...since he was in the crowd...and told him to step forward, no cap.
[3 Nephi 11:19] Nephi got up, moved forward, bowed low before the Lord, and kissed His feet...straight respect energy.
[3 Nephi 11:20] The Lord told him to get up, so Nephi bounced up and stood right there in front of Him, no hesitation.
[3 Nephi 11:21] The Lord laid it down: I'm handing you the plug to baptize these folks once I bounce back to heaven.
[3 Nephi 11:22] The Lord hit up others the same way, giving them the power to baptize and said: here's the move for baptizing...no cap, don't let any drama or beef pop off among y'all.
[3 Nephi 11:23] No cap, when someone turns from their sins after hearing y'all, and wants baptized in my name, here's the move: go down, stand in the water, and baptize them straight up in my name.
[3 Nephi 11:24] Now peep this, when you call them up by name, say these exact words:
[3 Nephi 11:25] By the authority Jesus Christ handed me, I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[3 Nephi 11:26] Then you gotta dunk them fully underwater and pull up right after...no half-measures.
[3 Nephi 11:27] This is how you baptize in my name...because for real, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are one squad; I'm in the Father, the Father's in me, straight unity vibes.
[3 Nephi 11:28] Bet, you baptize exactly like I said, and no more beef or arguments like before...especially not over my doctrine, say less.
[3 Nephi 11:29] No cap, anyone flexing that spirit of drama ain't rolling with me...they're with the devil, the original stirrer of fights, who fuels angry beef between people nonstop.
[3 Nephi 11:30] Real talk, my doctrine ain't about sparking anger or drama between peeps; it's about wiping that mess out for good.
[3 Nephi 11:31] Deadass, I'm about to lay out my doctrine for y'all, no cap.
[3 Nephi 11:32] Here's the tea: this doctrine comes straight from the Father, we both got receipts on each other, the Holy Ghost backs us too; and trust, the Father's telling everyone everywhere to repent and believe in me, say less.
[3 Nephi 11:33] Anyone who vibes with me and gets baptized is gonna be saved, and those are the real ones who inherit God's kingdom, no cap.
[3 Nephi 11:34] But if you don't believe in me and skip the baptism? Yeah, you're straight up doomed, no receipts needed.
[3 Nephi 11:35] Deadass, this is my doctrine with receipts from the Father; if you believe in me, you're also vibing with the Father, who'll hit you up with fire and the Holy Ghost, no cap.
[3 Nephi 11:36] So the Father reps me, the Holy Ghost reps both of us, cause the Father, me, and the Holy Ghost are straight-up one squad.
[3 Nephi 11:37] For real, I'm telling you again: you gotta repent, get that childlike vibe, and get baptized in my name, or you ain't getting these blessings at all.
[3 Nephi 11:38] No cap, I'm saying it twice: you gotta repent, get baptized in my name, and vibe like a little kid, or forget about inheriting God's kingdom.
[3 Nephi 11:39] No cap, this is my doctrine...if you build on it, you're stacking on my solid rock, and hell's gates ain't taking you down, period.
[3 Nephi 11:40] Anyone preaching more or less than this, calling it my doctrine, is straight-up sus and building on sand...when the storms hit, hell's gates are wide open for them, no cap.
[3 Nephi 11:41] So, go big and spread these words I dropped to every corner of the earth...no holding back, say less.
[3 Nephi 12:1] So Jesus drops these words to Nephi and the twelve handpicked to baptize, then flexes to the crowd saying: L's if you ignore these twelve I chose to serve y'all and baptize with water; after that, I'll hit you with fire and the Holy Ghost...blessed are you if you believe in me and get baptized once you see I'm the real deal.
[3 Nephi 12:2] Even bigger W for those who believe your words 'cause you saw me and know I'm real; low-key, those who humble themselves, get baptized, and trust will get hit with fire, the Holy Ghost, and their sins wiped clean.
[3 Nephi 12:3] Bet, the humble AF who pull up to me? The kingdom of heaven's already theirs, no cap.
[3 Nephi 12:4] Real talk, anyone feeling that deep sadness? They're gonna get the ultimate comfort, no cap.
[3 Nephi 12:5] Low-key, the meek are winning big...they're set to inherit the whole earth, no joke.
[3 Nephi 12:6] Major L for anyone starving for righteousness...they're gonna be fully plugged in with the Holy Ghost, no cap.
[3 Nephi 12:7] No cap, mercy-givers get mercy back...straight up payback vibes.
[3 Nephi 12:8] For real, pure hearts get the VIP pass...they'll actually see God, no cap.
[3 Nephi 12:9] Big ups to the peacemakers...they're flexing as legit children of God, no cap.
[3 Nephi 12:10] Real talk, anyone catching heat for reppin' my name? Your reward's the kingdom of heaven, straight L-to-W energy.
[3 Nephi 12:11] Yo, you're blessed when haters throw shade, spread lies, and come for you just 'cause you're repping me...say less.
[3 Nephi 12:12] Trust, you'll catch mad joy and flex hard in heaven 'cause the same shade was thrown at the OG prophets before you.
[3 Nephi 12:13] Deadass, I'm telling you, y'all are the salt of the earth; but if salt loses its flavor, how's the earth gonna get seasoned? That bland salt's just trash, fit only to get stepped on and tossed.
[3 Nephi 12:14] No cap, I'm making y'all the light for these people...like a city on a hill that can't be ghosted or hidden.
[3 Nephi 12:15] For real, nobody lights a candle just to hide it under a bucket...nah, it's put on a stand to shine on the whole crib.
[3 Nephi 12:16] So make your vibe so bright that everyone peeps your good moves and ends up hyping your Dad upstairs.
[3 Nephi 12:17] Don't get it twisted...I didn't roll up to cancel the law or prophets, I'm here to complete the whole plot, no cap.
[3 Nephi 12:18] Deadass, not a single letter or stroke from the law got ghosted; I came through and finished the whole thing.
[3 Nephi 12:19] Look, I gave you the rules and my Father's commands: believe in me, bounce from your sins, and roll up with a humble heart and real remorse. The commandments are all front and center, and the law's been sealed.
[3 Nephi 12:20] So slide up to me and get saved; real talk, if you don't follow my commands I just dropped, no cap...you ain't making it into heaven's kingdom.
[3 Nephi 12:21] You already know the old tea: it's written and said...don't kill, and if you do, God's judgment is coming for you, no cap.
[3 Nephi 12:22] But listen up: if you catch mad vibes at your bro, you're risking God's judgment; call him "Raca" and you're in trouble with the squad; say "You fool" and hellfire's on deck for you.
[3 Nephi 12:23] So if you're tryna come to me or wanna come, but you remember your bro's got beef with you...
[3 Nephi 12:24] Slide over to your bro, fix that drama first, then come to me with real intent...and I gotchu.
[3 Nephi 12:25] Squash beef fast while you're still on the move with your opponent, or else they'll catch you slipping and you'll end up locked down, no cap.
[3 Nephi 12:26] For real, you ain't getting out till you pay every last senine, and while stuck inside, can you drop even one? Nah, deadass no.
[3 Nephi 12:27] Peep this: the OGs wrote it down clear...no adultery, period.
[3 Nephi 12:28] But real talk, if you catch feels for a woman just by looking, you've already cheated in your heart, no cap.
[3 Nephi 12:29] Listen up, I'm dropping this command: don't let any of that toxic stuff slide into your heart.
[3 Nephi 12:30] Bet, it's way smarter to say no to these vibes and carry your cross than to get yeeted straight into hell.
[3 Nephi 12:31] It's been logged: if you're gonna ditch your wife, gotta hand her the official breakup receipt, no cap.
[3 Nephi 12:32] Real talk, if you dump your wife without the legit reason of fornication, you're pushing her to cheat; and anyone who marries a divorced woman is straight-up committing adultery.
[3 Nephi 12:33] Also, it's in the books: don't fake your promises, keep your word to the Lord no matter what.
[3 Nephi 12:34] Straight up, I'm telling you, don't swear by anything...not even heaven, 'cause that's God's throne, no cap.
[3 Nephi 12:35] And don't swear by the earth either, 'cause it's just God's footstool, facts only.
[3 Nephi 12:36] Plus, don't swear by your own head...like, you can't even control a single hair going black or white, no lie.
[3 Nephi 12:37] Keep it 100 with your words: Yea means yea, Nay means nay, anything extra is just sus vibes.
[3 Nephi 12:38] Check it, the rule's been set: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth ... straight-up fairness vibes.
[3 Nephi 12:39] Nah fam, I'm saying don't fight back at evil; if someone slaps your right cheek, flex by showing them the left one too.
[3 Nephi 12:40] If someone drags you to court and snags your coat, straight up hand over your cloak too...no cap.
[3 Nephi 12:41] If someone makes you walk a mile, flex by doubling it and walking two...extra main-character energy.
[3 Nephi 12:42] Always hand it over to anyone who asks, and don't ghost anyone who wants to borrow...say less.
[3 Nephi 12:43] Look, the scrolls say love your neighbor but throw shade at your enemy, but listen up…
[3 Nephi 12:44] Nah fam, I'm telling you to vibe with your enemies, bless the haters, do good to those who throw shade, and pray for the ones who drag you and persecute you...go big on the love.
[3 Nephi 12:45] So you can flex as true kids of your Heavenly Father who's chill enough to make the sun shine on both the good and the sus alike.
[3 Nephi 12:46] So yeah, all the old-school laws? I'm the plug who finished that whole script, no cap.
[3 Nephi 12:47] The old vibes are canceled, and everything's been rebooted fresh AF.
[3 Nephi 12:48] So I'm telling you to glow up to peak perfection, just like me and your Heavenly Father...no cap, aim that high.
[3 Nephi 13:1] For real, do good for the poor but don't flex your charity just to get clout from people...otherwise, your Heavenly Father's reward hits different and you get nada.
[3 Nephi 13:2] So when you help out, don't blast a trumpet like those fake influencers hyped up in synagogues and streets just for clout...they already got their shallow W's, no cap.
[3 Nephi 13:3] When you're handing out alms, keep it so low-key even your left hand's got no receipts on what your right hand's doing.
[3 Nephi 13:4] Keep your charity on the DL, 'cause your Father who's got 24/7 vision will bless you loud and proud when no one's watching.
[3 Nephi 13:5] When you pray, don't be like those clout-chasing hypocrites who stand in synagogues and street corners just to get seen...trust, they already copped their fake W.
[3 Nephi 13:6] Nah, when you pray, slide into your closet, shut the door, and chat with your Father on the low; He's watching in secret and will flex your reward front and center.
[3 Nephi 13:7] Heads up: don't spam your prayers with empty repeats like the heathen, thinking more words = guaranteed receipts; that hustle's weak energy.
[3 Nephi 13:8] So don't be like them; your Father's already got the tea on what you need before you even slide into His DMs.
[3 Nephi 13:9] So when you pray, say it like this: Our Father up in heaven, your name's straight-up sacred, no cap.
[3 Nephi 13:10] Let your will go viral on earth just like it's always trending in heaven.
[3 Nephi 13:11] And forgive our debts like we're quick to forgive those who owe us...no cap, keep it 100.
[3 Nephi 13:12] Don't let us catch feels for temptation; pull us out the bad vibes and keep us safe from evil's sus moves.
[3 Nephi 13:13] 'Cause yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glow-up forever and always. Amen, say less.
[3 Nephi 13:14] No cap, if you forgive others' slips, your heavenly Father's gonna forgive you too...straight up.
[3 Nephi 13:15] But if you're holding grudges and not forgiving, don't expect your Father to drop forgiveness your way...no cap.
[3 Nephi 13:16] Also, when you fast, don't do the fake sad face flex like hypocrites tryna stunt for the crowd; real talk, that's all the clout they get.
[3 Nephi 13:17] But you, when you fast, keep it low-key: put some oil on your head and wash your face like you're vibin', not flexin'.
[3 Nephi 13:18] Don't fast just to get clout from people...do it for your Father who's low-key watching; He'll bless you out loud when no one else is looking.
[3 Nephi 13:19] Don't stash your treasure on earth where moths and rust mess it up and thieves slide through to jack your stuff.
[3 Nephi 13:20] Instead, flex with treasures in heaven where no moth, rust, or thief can touch your drip...secure and untouchable.
[3 Nephi 13:21] No cap, wherever your treasure's at, that's where your heart's gonna vibe too.
[3 Nephi 13:22] Your eye's like the body's flashlight...if your vision's focused and no cap single-minded, your whole vibe shines bright.
[3 Nephi 13:23] But if your eye's sus, your whole vibe's gonna be dark AF; so if your inner light's actually darkness, bruh, that's peak darkness energy.
[3 Nephi 13:24] You can't vibe with two bosses at once; you'll end up hating one and stan the other. Bottom line: you can't flex God and Mammon at the same time, say less.
[3 Nephi 13:25] So Jesus said to his twelve chosen squad, "Keep my words locked in. You're the ones I picked to serve these folks, so chill about what you eat, drink, or wear...life's way bigger than snacks and drip, no cap."
[3 Nephi 13:26] Look at the birds...they don't grind planting or harvesting, no barns or storage, yet your Heavenly Father keeps them fed. You're way above them, so chill and trust the process.
[3 Nephi 13:27] Real talk, who here can flex and add even one cubit to their height just by stressing about it? Nope, thought energy don't work like that.
[3 Nephi 13:28] So why you stressed about clout clothes? Peep the lilies in the field...they grow without hustle or spinning thread, just vibing naturally.
[3 Nephi 13:29] And low-key, even Solomon flexed way less drip than these lilies in all his glory, no cap.
[3 Nephi 13:30] So if God can lace up the grass that's here today and toast tomorrow, he'll def hook you up too...unless your faith's hella weak, no cap.
[3 Nephi 13:31] So stop stressing like, "What we eating? What we sipping? What drip we rocking?" Just chill, God got this.
[3 Nephi 13:32] Your Heavenly Father's got receipts ... He knows you need all that, no cap.
[3 Nephi 13:33] Prioritize chasing God's kingdom and His vibe first, and everything else will slide into your DMs, no cap.
[3 Nephi 13:34] Don't sweat tomorrow's drama; it'll handle its own mess. One day's chaos at a time is all you need, say less.
[3 Nephi 14:1] After dropping those words, Jesus faced the crowd and said straight up, "For real, don't be throwing shade or you're gonna catch it back, no cap."
[3 Nephi 14:2] How you judge others? That same vibe's coming back to you, like a boomerang...same energy, same receipt.
[3 Nephi 14:3] Why you peeping that tiny speck in your brother's eye but ignoring the massive log chillin' in your own? Get a grip, fam.
[3 Nephi 14:4] How you gonna tell your bro, "Let me fix that speck in your eye," when you're rocking a whole-ass log in yours? That's mad sus.
[3 Nephi 14:5] Yo, fake, get that log outta your own eye first, then you'll have the clarity to help your bro with his speck, no cap.
[3 Nephi 14:6] Don't flex your sacred stuff to the dogs or throw pearls to pigs...they'll just stomp on it and then come back to mess you up, low-key savage.
[3 Nephi 14:7] Ask up and you'll get the plug; seek and you'll stumble on the vibe; knock and doors will slide open for you.
[3 Nephi 14:8] No cap, anyone who asks gets hooked up; the seekers find the drip; and knockers get doors unlocked, facts.
[3 Nephi 14:9] Who out here gonna give their kid a damn rock when they straight-up ask for bread? That's just sus.
[3 Nephi 14:10] And if his kid's asking for a fish, he ain't handing over a snake, that's just wild.
[3 Nephi 14:11] If y'all, low-key flawed, still know how to bless your kids with good stuff, imagine how much more your Heavenly Father's gonna hook up those who ask.
[3 Nephi 14:12] So, treat others how you wanna be treated...straight facts, that's the whole vibe of the law and the prophets, say less.
[3 Nephi 14:13] Slide through the narrow gate 'cause the wide gate and broad path flex destruction...and trust, tons are taking that L.
[3 Nephi 14:14] The narrow gate and tight path lead to life's glow-up, but not many are about that grind to find it, real talk.
[3 Nephi 14:15] Watch out for fake prophets flexing sheep vibes but low-key are savage wolves ready to clout-chase and snatch your trust.
[3 Nephi 14:16] You'll peep fake folks by their receipts...no one grabs grapes from thorns or figs from weeds, facts.
[3 Nephi 14:17] For real, good trees drop good fruit, but busted trees only spit toxic vibes...can't fake the feed.
[3 Nephi 14:18] No cap, a good tree ain't gonna serve up bad fruit, and a corrupt tree can't bless you with good fruit...facts don't lie.
[3 Nephi 14:19] Any tree that can't deliver the goods gets chopped and tossed into the fire...no exceptions, that's the tea.
[3 Nephi 14:20] So, for real, you'll clock people by their fruits...what they bring to the table don't lie.
[3 Nephi 14:21] Saying "Lord, Lord" ain't your VIP pass to heaven's kingdom...only those who actually vibe with God the Father's will get in, no cap.
[3 Nephi 14:22] Tons will hit me up that day like, "Lord, Lord, didn't we flex prophesying, exorcising demons, and performing mad miracles all in your name?"
[3 Nephi 14:23] Then I'll hit 'em with the real talk: "I don't even know you, bounce off me, y'all riding with wickedness."
[3 Nephi 14:24] So, anyone who hears my words and actually acts on them is like a smart dude building his crib on solid rock...say less.
[3 Nephi 14:25] When the storm hits...rain pouring, floods rising, winds flexing hard...that house stands strong cuz it's built on rock, no cap.
[3 Nephi 14:26] But if you hear my words and ghost on doing them, you're that clueless dude building his crib on sand...big L incoming.
[3 Nephi 14:27] Then when the storms drop...rain floodin', winds raging...that sandy house crashes hard, and the fall? Mad devastating, no cap.
[3 Nephi 15:1] So after Jesus dropped those bars, he scanned the crowd and said, "Y'all heard my lessons before I bounced to my Father; if you remember and flex those words, I'll raise you up big time on the last day."
[3 Nephi 15:2] After Jesus said this, he noticed some folks low-key shook and confused about what he meant about the law of Moses...like, they didn't catch that the old vibes were done and everything got a fresh reboot.
[3 Nephi 15:3] He told them straight up, "Don't be shook that I said the old ways dipped and everything's been upgraded, say less."
[3 Nephi 15:4] Look, I'm telling you the law Moses got? Yeah, it's fully completed, no cap.
[3 Nephi 15:5] Look, I'm the OG who handed down the law and made the deal with Israel, so the law's done and dusted in me...I came to finish it, so it's officially over.
[3 Nephi 15:6] Look, I ain't canceling the prophets; all the stuff they said that hasn't happened yet? Trust, it'll all come through in me, no cap.
[3 Nephi 15:7] Just 'cause I said the old stuff's over doesn't mean I'm wiping out the prophecies about what's next...they still stand, bet.
[3 Nephi 15:8] Peep this: my deal with my people ain't fully done yet, but the law Moses got? Yeah, it wraps up with me, no cap.
[3 Nephi 15:9] Yo, I'm the law and the light. Keep your eyes on me, hold it down till the finish, and you're gonna live forever...real eternal life vibes for those who stick it out.
[3 Nephi 15:10] Look, I dropped commandments for you, so stick to 'em. That's the whole law and prophet flex...they were all about me, no cap.
[3 Nephi 15:11] So after Jesus finished talking, he hit up the twelve he handpicked and said:
[3 Nephi 15:12] Y'all my disciples, shining bright for these people...leftover squad from the house of Joseph, no cap.
[3 Nephi 15:13] Yo, this land's your inheritance, straight-up gifted by the Father, no cap.
[3 Nephi 15:14] And real talk, the Father never told me to spill this to your bros in Jerusalem, no cap.
[3 Nephi 15:15] Also, the Father never told me to dish this to the other Israel tribes He moved outta that land, no receipts.
[3 Nephi 15:16] The Father did tell me one thing to share with them, straight up:
[3 Nephi 15:17] I got other sheep not in this crew, and I gotta bring them too...they'll hear my voice, and we'll all be one squad under one shepherd, no cap.
[3 Nephi 15:18] But lowkey, cuz they were stubborn and unbelieving, they couldn't get my message; so Father told me to stop dropping more on this to them, say less.
[3 Nephi 15:19] Real talk, the Father told me to say y'all got split from them 'cause of their sin; that's why they don't even know you, straight facts.
[3 Nephi 15:20] For real, the Father also separated the other tribes 'cause of their sins, so they don't know them either, no cap.
[3 Nephi 15:21] Deadass, y'all are the "other sheep" I talked about...outside this squad...but I'm bringing you in so you'll hear my voice, and we're gonna be one fold under one shepherd, bet.
[3 Nephi 15:22] They didn't get me at all, thinking I meant the Gentiles; they low-key didn't realize the Gentiles would flip their vibe through their preaching.
[3 Nephi 15:23] They totally missed that I said they'd hear my voice, and didn't get that the Gentiles wouldn't hear it directly...only through the Holy Ghost's whisper, no cap.
[3 Nephi 15:24] But look, y'all have heard me and seen me, you're my sheep, officially on the Father's guest list, no cap.
[3 Nephi 16:1] For real, I got other sheep not from this land, not Jerusalem, or anywhere nearby where I've been doing my thing.
[3 Nephi 16:2] The folks I'm talking about haven't heard my voice yet, and I haven't shown up to them at all, no cap.
[3 Nephi 16:3] The Father straight-up told me to roll up to them, so they'll hear my voice and join my squad...one fold, one shepherd vibe...so I'm heading their way to show face.
[3 Nephi 16:4] I'm telling y'all to write this down after I dip, so if my Jerusalem crew...who chill with me and saw my moves...don't hit up the Father asking in my name to get the 411 on y'all and the other tribes they don't know, then these words will be saved and shown to the Gentiles; and when the Gentiles' time peaks, the leftover fam scattered worldwide 'cause of unbelief will get woke to me, their Redeemer.
[3 Nephi 16:5] Then I'm pulling them in from all corners of the earth to flex on the promise the Father made to the whole house of Israel, say less.
[3 Nephi 16:6] Big ups to the Gentiles for their faith in me and the Holy Ghost, who low-key flexes on them about me and the Father.
[3 Nephi 16:7] Look, the Father says 'cause the Gentiles believe in me and y'all, house of Israel, be sus with unbelief, in the end times the truth's gonna drop on the Gentiles, and they'll get the full tea.'
[3 Nephi 16:8] But yo, the Father throws shade at the unbelieving Gentiles...even though they rolled up on this land and scattered my Israel crew, who've been ghosted and stepped on by them hard.
[3 Nephi 16:9] Because of the Father's mercy on the Gentiles and His judgments on my Israel crew, for real, after all this...when my people got smacked, stressed, killed, kicked out, hated, and turned into the community's cringe meme...
[3 Nephi 16:10] So the Father's like, when the Gentiles start sinning on my gospel, ghost the full truth, get all high-key arrogant, full of lies, scams, hypocrisy, murders, fake priest moves, cheating, and sketchy secrets...and still reject the full gospel...watch, I'm gonna snatch the full gospel back from them, no cap.
[3 Nephi 16:11] Then I'll remember the promise I made to my people, house of Israel, and I'll drop my gospel straight to them.
[3 Nephi 16:12] I'll prove to you, house of Israel, that Gentiles won't flex on you; I'll keep my promise, and y'all will catch the full vibe of my gospel.
[3 Nephi 16:13] But if the Gentiles hit rewind, repent, and come back to me, the Father says they'll get clapped into my people, house of Israel, no cap.
[3 Nephi 16:14] The Father says I won't let my Israel squad get crushed or stepped on by them.
[3 Nephi 16:15] But if they don't bounce back to me and chill with my voice, I'll let them...and my people, house of Israel...get stomped on like salt that lost its flavor, basically useless and ready to be tossed and trampled by my Israel crew.
[3 Nephi 16:16] For real, the Father told me straight up...this land is gonna be your squad's inheritance, no cap.
[3 Nephi 16:17] Then Isaiah's prophecy gonna come through, saying this:
[3 Nephi 16:18] Your watchmen gonna squad up, raise their voices, and sing in unison 'cause they'll be vibing the same when the Lord brings Zion back.
[3 Nephi 16:19] Yo, burst out with hype and sing loud, empty spots of Jerusalem, 'cause the Lord's got His people's back and saved Jerusalem big time.
[3 Nephi 16:20] The Lord's flexed His holy power for all nations to see, and everyone on earth's gonna witness God's salvation, no cap.
[3 Nephi 17:1] So Jesus was done talking, looked around the crowd, and said straight up: Yo, my time's almost here.
[3 Nephi 17:2] I see y'all struggling to catch all my words right now...Father told me to say this, but you're low-key too weak to get it all at once.
[3 Nephi 17:3] So bounce back to your cribs, vibe on what I said, hit up the Father in my name for clarity, get your minds ready for tomorrow when I roll through again.
[3 Nephi 17:4] Now I'm heading back to the Father, and I'm gonna flex to the lost tribes of Israel...they ain't really lost to Him, 'cause He knows exactly where He's got them at.
[3 Nephi 17:5] When Jesus finished, he scanned the crowd, saw them all crying and locked in on him like, "Yo, can you stay a bit longer?"
[3 Nephi 17:6] He told them straight up: My heart's full of mad compassion for y'all.
[3 Nephi 17:7] Got anyone sick or hurt? Bring 'em over...lame, blind, limping, missing parts, leprous, withered, deaf, or struggling in any way...I'll heal 'em, no cap, 'cause my heart's bursting with mercy for you.
[3 Nephi 17:8] I see y'all wanna peep what I did for your Jerusalem fam, and low-key your faith is strong enough for me to heal you too.
[3 Nephi 17:9] After Jesus said that, the whole squad rolled up with their sick, lame, blind, mute, and anyone struggling, and he healed every single one as they came through...no cap.
[3 Nephi 17:10] Everyone...healed or healthy...bowed at his feet and worshipped him; so many came through they even kissed his feet, straight-up bathing them in tears.
[3 Nephi 17:11] Then he straight-up told them to bring the little kids over.
[3 Nephi 17:12] They rolled up with their little kids and set 'em down all around Jesus, who stood in the middle; the crowd made space so every kid could get to him.
[3 Nephi 17:13] Once all the kids were there and Jesus was chillin' in the middle, he told the crowd to drop to their knees on the ground.
[3 Nephi 17:14] When they knelt down, Jesus lowkey groaned and said, "Father, this wickedness from Israel's people's got me shook."
[3 Nephi 17:15] After saying that, Jesus dropped to his knees too and prayed to the Father...what he said was straight-up unwriteable, but the crowd kept receipts on everyone who heard it.
[3 Nephi 17:16] They flexed big time saying: no eye ever peeped, no ear ever caught anything as wild and epic as what Jesus dropped when talking to the Father.
[3 Nephi 17:17] No cap, no words or writing can flex how insane what Jesus said was, and no heart could even vibe with the mad joy that flooded us hearing him pray for us to the Father.
[3 Nephi 17:18] When Jesus finished praying, he stood up, but the crowd was hit so hard with joy they totally lost it.
[3 Nephi 17:19] Jesus spoke up and told them to get back up on their feet.
[3 Nephi 17:20] They got up, and Jesus said, "Y'all blessed for that mad faith. And low-key, my joy's over the top right now."
[3 Nephi 17:21] After dropping those words, Jesus straight-up started crying, the crowd saw it, and he grabbed the little kids one by one to bless and pray for them to the Father.
[3 Nephi 17:22] After that, Jesus broke down and wept once more.
[3 Nephi 17:23] Jesus looked at the crowd and was like, "Yo, peep your little ones right here."
[3 Nephi 17:24] They looked up and saw the sky split open, angels rolling down like they were on fire, surrounding the kids with flames, straight-up ministering to them...big energy.
[3 Nephi 17:25] The whole crowd, like 2,500 strong...men, women, and kids...all saw, heard, and kept solid receipts, knowing their story was 100% legit, each one witnessing it for themselves.
[3 Nephi 18:1] Jesus told his squad to bring him some bread and wine, no cap.
[3 Nephi 18:2] While the crew grabbed bread and wine, Jesus told the crowd to just chill and sit down on the ground.
[3 Nephi 18:3] When the disciples came back with bread and wine, Jesus broke the bread, blessed it, handed it out, and told them to eat up.
[3 Nephi 18:4] After they ate their fill, Jesus told them to pass it around to the whole crowd.
[3 Nephi 18:5] After the crowd was full, Jesus told the disciples, "One of y'all will get ordained, and I'll give them the power to break bread, bless it, and serve it to everyone in my church who believes and gets baptized in my name."
[3 Nephi 18:6] Y'all gotta keep this ritual going, just like I did...breaking bread, blessing it, and passing it to you.
[3 Nephi 18:7] Do this to remember my body, which I showed you. It's your receipts to the Father that you never forget me, and if you do, my Spirit will be riding with you.
[3 Nephi 18:8] Right after saying this, Jesus told his disciples to sip from the cup and pass it around so the whole crowd could drink too...say less.
[3 Nephi 18:9] They did just that...drank their fill, then passed it to the crowd who also drank up and got full.
[3 Nephi 18:10] After the disciples handled that, Jesus said, "Big W to y'all for doing this...it's ticking all my command boxes and flexing to the Father that you're down to follow my orders."
[3 Nephi 18:11] Y'all gotta keep doing this for everyone who repents and gets baptized in my name, remembering my blood I shed for you, showing the Father you never forget me ... and if you keep that memory lit, my Spirit's gonna stick with you.
[3 Nephi 18:12] Here's the command: keep doing these moves, and you're blessed 'cause you're built solid on my rock, no cap.
[3 Nephi 18:13] But if anyone does more or less than this, you ain't built on my rock; you're on shaky sand, so when storms hit, you're gonna collapse and hell's gates are wide open waiting.
[3 Nephi 18:14] So fr, big blessings if you stick to my commandments...Father told me to hand them down to you.
[3 Nephi 18:15] No cap, you gotta stay woke and pray 24/7, or the devil's gonna sus you and drag you off like a lost noob.
[3 Nephi 18:16] Just like I prayed with y'all, that's how you gotta pray in my squad...among those who've repented and got baptized in my name. Heads up, I'm the light and set the vibe for you to follow.
[3 Nephi 18:17] After dropping these words to his disciples, Jesus spun back to the crowd and said:
[3 Nephi 18:18] Real talk, you gotta stay woke and pray nonstop or you'll fall into temptation...Satan's out here tryna flex and sift you like wheat.
[3 Nephi 18:19] So for real, always hit up the Father with prayers in my name...no cap.
[3 Nephi 18:20] Whatever you ask the Father in my name, if it's legit and you believe you'll get it, say less ... it's yours.
[3 Nephi 18:21] Always pray to the Father in my name with your fam, so your wives and kids catch those blessings, no cap.
[3 Nephi 18:22] Bet, y'all gotta link up all the time and never block anyone tryna roll through...let everyone pull up, no gatekeeping.
[3 Nephi 18:23] Instead, pray for those folks and don't ghost them; if they keep showing up, keep praying for them to the Father in my name, no cap.
[3 Nephi 18:24] So flex your light so it shines on the whole world. I'm the light you gotta rep...what you've seen me do and pray to the Father, y'all saw it firsthand.
[3 Nephi 18:25] You peep I told y'all not to dip but to come thru to me to vibe and see for yourselves; do the same with the world or you're just asking to catch temptation, no cap.
[3 Nephi 18:26] After Jesus dropped those bars, he looked back at his chosen crew and said:
[3 Nephi 18:27] Real talk, I'm about to hit you with one more command before I bounce to my Father to handle other commands He dropped on me, no cap.
[3 Nephi 18:28] So here's the deal: don't let anyone who's not worthy take my flesh and blood when y'all serve it...no sus moves.
[3 Nephi 18:29] Anyone who vibes with my flesh and blood unworthily is basically signing up for soul-level L's; so if you know someone's not worthy, straight up block them from it.
[3 Nephi 18:30] But don't ghost him completely...serve him and pray for him to the Father in my name; if he repents and gets baptized in my name, then welcome him back and serve up my flesh and blood.
[3 Nephi 18:31] If he stays sus and won't repent, he's not in the squad...can't let him mess up my people, 'cause I know my sheep and they're all accounted for.
[3 Nephi 18:32] Still, don't kick him outta your synagogues or worship spots...keep serving him up, 'cause you never know if he'll bounce back, repent, and roll up to me with real heart, and I'll heal him; y'all might just be the plug for his salvation.
[3 Nephi 18:33] So, stick to these commands I gave or risk catching major condemnation...trust, you don't wanna be the one the Father shades hard.
[3 Nephi 18:34] I'm dropping these commands 'cause y'all been beefin' hard...big W for anyone who's vibin' with zero drama.
[3 Nephi 18:35] Now I'm heading to the Father 'cause it's the move that's best for y'all, no cap.
[3 Nephi 18:36] After Jesus finished flexin' these words, he tapped each chosen disciple one by one and spoke to them as he touched each.
[3 Nephi 18:37] The crowd didn't catch what he said, so no receipts from them, but the disciples got proof he gave them the power to drop the Holy Ghost, and I'll show y'all later that this tea is 100% legit.
[3 Nephi 18:38] Once Jesus finished tapping everyone, a cloud rolled in and low-key blocked the crowd's view so they couldn't see him anymore.
[3 Nephi 18:39] While the cloud had them blocked, he dipped and ascended to heaven; the disciples saw the whole move and clapped back with receipts that he really bounced up there again.
[3 Nephi 19:1] After Jesus ascended, the crowd bounced, each dude grabbed his wife and kids, and everybody dipped back to their own crib.
[3 Nephi 19:2] Word spread fast before night even hit that the crowd had seen Jesus, he served up some real talk, and he'd flex again for the masses tomorrow.
[3 Nephi 19:3] For real, the whole night buzz was all about Jesus; so many peeps, like a crazy huge crowd, grinded hard through the night just to be front and center when Jesus showed up again the next day.
[3 Nephi 19:4] Next day, the crowd pulled up, and there was Nephi, his resurrected bro Timothy, his son Jonas, plus Mathoni, Mathonihah, Kumen, Kumenonhi, Jeremiah, Shemnon, Jonas, Zedekiah, and Isaiah...the squad Jesus picked...and they flexed right in the middle of everyone.
[3 Nephi 19:5] The crowd was mad huge, so they split into twelve squads to keep things chill.
[3 Nephi 19:6] The twelve went full teacher mode, making the crowd drop to their knees and hit up the Father, all in Jesus' name, no cap.
[3 Nephi 19:7] The disciples also prayed to the Father in Jesus' name, then they got up and started serving the people, straight up.
[3 Nephi 19:8] After dropping the exact same Jesus-level wisdom...no cap, no edits...they got down on their knees again and prayed to the Father in Jesus' name.
[3 Nephi 19:9] They prayed hard for what they really wanted...straight up asking the Father to hook them up with the Holy Ghost.
[3 Nephi 19:10] After that prayer sesh, they rolled down to the water's edge, and the whole crowd trailed right behind.
[3 Nephi 19:11] Nephi dipped into the water and got baptized, no cap.
[3 Nephi 19:12] He surfaced and started baptizing, going through everyone Jesus had picked...big mood.
[3 Nephi 19:13] After everyone got baptized and stepped up from the water, the Holy Ghost came through hard, filling them up with Spirit and fire vibes.
[3 Nephi 19:14] For real, they got surrounded like they were wrapped in fire from heaven; the crowd saw the whole thing, giving receipts, while angels dropped down and served them.
[3 Nephi 19:15] While angels were doing their thing with the disciples, Jesus pulled up, stood right in the middle, and started serving them too...main-character energy for real.
[3 Nephi 19:16] Jesus told the crowd to drop to their knees again, and told his disciples to do the same...say less, time to pray.
[3 Nephi 19:17] Once everyone was kneeling, Jesus told his disciples to start praying...no cap, get that vibe right.
[3 Nephi 19:18] They kicked off their prayers, calling Jesus their Lord and God...straight-up worship mode activated.
[3 Nephi 19:19] Jesus dipped out from the crowd, stepped a bit away, bowed down to the ground, and said:
[3 Nephi 19:20] Father, big thanks for hooking up the Holy Ghost to those I picked; they're the real ones 'cause they believe in me, that's why I chose them over the world.
[3 Nephi 19:21] Father, I'm asking you to bless everyone who trusts their words with the Holy Ghost...no cap, spread that vibe.
[3 Nephi 19:22] Father, you gave them the Holy Ghost 'cause they believe in me; you see their faith since you hear their prayers, and they pray 'cause I'm right there with them.
[3 Nephi 19:23] Now Father, I'm praying for them and anyone who'll vibe with their words, so they believe in me and I can live in them like you live in me...straight-up unity goals.
[3 Nephi 19:24] After Jesus prayed to the Father, he came back to his disciples, who were still nonstop praying to him...no extra fluff, just straight-up focused 'cause they got the prayer cheat code and mad passion.
[3 Nephi 19:25] Jesus blessed them mid-prayer; his face was glowing with a smile, shining so bright they turned whiter than his own robes...no cap, nothing on earth flexes that level of pure white.
[3 Nephi 19:26] Jesus said, "Keep praying," and for real, they didn't stop grinding on those prayers.
[3 Nephi 19:27] Jesus dipped away again, bowed low to the ground, and hit the Father up with another prayer, saying:
[3 Nephi 19:28] Father, thanks for purifying the ones I picked 'cause of their faith; I'm praying for them and anyone who trusts their words, that they get purified in me just like they did.
[3 Nephi 19:29] Father, I'm not praying for the whole world, just the ones you gave me from it 'cause of their faith, so they get purified in me and I'm in them like you're in me...straight up one crew, and I get mad glorified through them.
[3 Nephi 19:30] After Jesus dropped those words, he rolled back to his disciples, who were still praying hard nonstop; he gave them that same smile, and they shined just as white as Jesus himself.
[3 Nephi 19:31] Then Jesus bounced a bit away and hit up the Father with another prayer.
[3 Nephi 19:32] No human tongue can spill the words he prayed, and no one can write down that fire either.
[3 Nephi 19:33] The crowd heard and gave receipts, their hearts wide open, low-key understanding every word he prayed deep inside.
[3 Nephi 19:34] Real talk, his prayers were so next-level and amazing that no one can write or spit them out properly.
[3 Nephi 19:35] When Jesus finished praying, he rolled back to his disciples and said, "Yo, I've never seen faith this big among the Jews; no cap, their unbelief blocked me from flexing miracles like this."
[3 Nephi 19:36] No joke, y'all have seen way crazier stuff and heard way deeper truths than anyone else out there.
[3 Nephi 20:1] Jesus told the whole squad to chill on the prayers out loud, including his disciples, but said keep that heart prayer game strong and steady, no cap.
[3 Nephi 20:2] He told them to get up and stand tall, so they bounced up and stood firm on their feet, no hesitation.
[3 Nephi 20:3] Then Jesus broke bread, blessed it, and handed it out to the disciples to munch on.
[3 Nephi 20:4] After they ate, Jesus told them to break more bread and share it with the whole crowd...say less, spread the love.
[3 Nephi 20:5] Once the crowd was fed, he passed out wine too and told them to pour it up for everyone else, no cap.
[3 Nephi 20:6] Heads up, neither the disciples nor the crowd rolled up with bread or wine...they weren't even flexing that.
[3 Nephi 20:7] But for real, he legit hooked them up with bread to eat and wine to sip, no receipts needed.
[3 Nephi 20:8] He said, "Whoever munches this bread is vibing with my body deep in their soul; whoever sips this wine's tapping into my blood, so their soul's never starving or dry, always fully loaded."
[3 Nephi 20:9] After the whole crowd ate and drank, they got major Spirit energy, all yelling in sync, hyping up Jesus who they saw and heard firsthand.
[3 Nephi 20:10] After they all hyped up Jesus, he said, "Bet, I'm wrapping up the Father's command about y'all...the last crew from Israel's ancient fam."
[3 Nephi 20:11] Remember when I told y'all that Isaiah's words would come true? Well, they're right here, written out...so peep them and do your homework.
[3 Nephi 20:12] No cap, when Isaiah's words go down, that's when the Father's promise to His peeps...the house of Israel...gets fully locked in.
[3 Nephi 20:13] Then all the scattered leftovers across the globe...from east, west, south, and north...will be pulled back and finally get woke about the Lord who saved them.
[3 Nephi 20:14] The Father told me straight up to hand over this land to y'all as your legit inheritance...no cap.
[3 Nephi 20:15] I'm telling you, if the Gentiles don't hit that repentance after stacking blessings and still mess with my people, they're playing a risky game.
[3 Nephi 20:16] Then y'all, the last of Jacob's crew, will roll up into the crowd, standing tall like a lion flexing on the forest beasts and sheep...you stomp, you tear, and no one can save 'em from your clout.
[3 Nephi 20:17] Your hand's gonna be raised big time over your haters, and all your enemies? Consider them wiped out, no cap.
[3 Nephi 20:18] I'm gonna pull my people back like a farmer scooping up their sheaves, bringing them tight to the spot...no cap.
[3 Nephi 20:19] I'm boosting my squad, the Father's chosen...your horn's gonna be iron, your hooves brass, smashing crowds left and right; all the loot you snag? It's gonna be holy, set apart for the Lord of the whole earth. And yeah, I'm the one making that power move.
[3 Nephi 20:20] The Father says His sword of justice will hang over them that day; if they don't repent, it's coming down hard on them...all the Gentile nations better take note.
[3 Nephi 20:21] Watch this: I'm about to set up my people, the house of Israel, solid and unshakable.
[3 Nephi 20:22] Peep this: I'm locking down this crew in this land to seal the deal I made with your dad Jacob; it's gonna be a New Jerusalem, and the whole squad of heaven ... yep, even me ... will be vibing right in the middle of y'all.
[3 Nephi 20:23] Look, I'm the one Moses flexed about...God's prophet coming from your own squad, like him; you better listen to everything I drop. Anyone ghosting that prophet? They're getting cut from the crew, no exceptions.
[3 Nephi 20:24] Low-key, all the prophets...from Samuel on down...have been spilling receipts about me, no cap.
[3 Nephi 20:25] FYI, y'all are straight-up children of the prophets, repping the house of Israel and that OG covenant the Father made with your forefathers...Abraham got the prophecy that through his seed, every nation's gonna catch those blessings.
[3 Nephi 20:26] The Father hyped me up to you first, sending me to bless y'all by helping you bounce from your sins...'cause you're straight from that covenant fam.
[3 Nephi 20:27] After y'all got blessed, the Father locked in the covenant with Abraham...saying all nations get blessings through your seed...by dropping the Holy Ghost on the Gentiles through me, making them hella powerful, even enough to scatter my peeps, house of Israel.
[3 Nephi 20:28] They'll be straight-up a scourge to the people here, but once they get the full gospel and still dodge me with hardened hearts, the Father says He'll bounce their sins right back onto them, no cap.
[3 Nephi 20:29] I'm keeping the covenant I made with my people; promised to gather them up in my perfect timing and hand back their ancestors' land ... Jerusalem, their forever promised spot, says the Father.
[3 Nephi 20:30] Real talk, the day's coming when the full gospel's gonna be preached to them, no cap.
[3 Nephi 20:31] They'll catch the vibe and believe I'm Jesus Christ, God's Son, and hit up the Father straight up in my name.
[3 Nephi 20:32] Then their watchmen will squad up, raising their voices in one dope harmony, 'cause finally, they're seeing eye to eye.
[3 Nephi 20:33] The Father's gonna pull them back together and hand over Jerusalem as their legit inheritance, no cap.
[3 Nephi 20:34] Then they'll burst out happy...yo, wastelands of Jerusalem, sing up, 'cause the Father's comforted his crew and redeemed the city.
[3 Nephi 20:35] The Father's flexin' His holy power in front of every nation; all corners of the earth will witness His salvation, and fam, the Father and I? We're one squad.
[3 Nephi 20:36] Then the prophecy kicks in: Wake up, Zion, flex your strength; deck yourself out in your finest, Jerusalem, holy city...no more unclean or uncircumcised vibes allowed in your crew, period.
[3 Nephi 20:37] Dust off, rise up, Jerusalem...pull those chains off your neck, captive daughter of Zion, and sit with main-character energy.
[3 Nephi 20:38] The Lord's saying: y'all sold out for nothing, but don't stress ... you'll be redeemed for free, no cash needed.
[3 Nephi 20:39] Deadass, no cap, my people will know my name; on that day, they'll peep that I'm the real one talkin'.
[3 Nephi 20:40] Then they'll be like, "Yo, mad respect to the one whose feet hit the mountains bringing hype news...peace, good vibes, salvation...telling Zion straight up: Your God's running the show!"
[3 Nephi 20:41] Then the call drops: Dip out, bounce from there, don't vibe with anything sus; leave her crew and stay clean if you're holding the Lord's gear.
[3 Nephi 20:42] No need to dip in a mad rush or bolt; the Lord's flexing upfront, and Israel's God's got your back squad.
[3 Nephi 20:43] Peep this: my servant's gonna play it smart, get mad uplifted, hyped, and reach peak main-character status.
[3 Nephi 20:44] A ton of people were shook by him...his face was wrecked worse than anyone's, and his whole look beat everyone else's by a mile.
[3 Nephi 20:45] He's gonna flex on many nations; even the kings will be speechless 'cause they're about to witness stuff no one's ratted on before and process unheard truths.
[3 Nephi 20:46] No cap, all this is gonna pop off just like the Father told me; then the Father's deal with his people locks in, Jerusalem gets reoccupied by my crew, and becomes their legit homeland again.
[3 Nephi 21:1] Yo, for real, I'm dropping a sign so y'all can clock when it's about to go down...I'll round up my peeps, House of Israel, from their long scatter and set up my Zion right in their midst again.
[3 Nephi 21:2] Check this, here's your sign...when the stuff I'm spilling now and later, powered by the Holy Ghost the Father hooks you up with, gets dropped to the Gentiles so they get the tea on this remnant crew from Jacob's house and how my people get scattered by them.
[3 Nephi 21:3] No cap, when the Father lets this info loose to them and it flows from them straight to you, that's when things get real.
[3 Nephi 21:4] The Father's got the brainwave that they should be settled here, living free by His power, so His truths flow from them to a remnant of your squad, sealing the deal He made with His people, House of Israel.
[3 Nephi 21:5] So, when these moves and future ones drop from the Gentiles to your crew who start ghosting faith 'cause they caught mad sin vibes, pay attention.
[3 Nephi 21:6] The Father's plan is that this truth pops off through the Gentiles so He can flex His power; if they keep it 100 and don't harden up, they'll repent, roll up baptized in my name, catch the real drip of my doctrine, and get added to my squad, House of Israel.
[3 Nephi 21:7] When your crew starts peeping this stuff, that's the sign they need...proof the Father's hustle is already on, grinding to lock down His promise to the House of Israel.
[3 Nephi 21:8] When that day drops, kings will get mad quiet...seeing stuff no one's ever spilled before and finally zoning in on unheard truths.
[3 Nephi 21:9] On that day, the Father's gonna pull off a major flex for me...big and legendary...but some folks will still be sus and not buy it, even with someone dropping the receipts right in their faces.
[3 Nephi 21:10] Bet, my servant's life is locked in my grip; they can't really end him, even if they mess him up a bit. I'll fix him up and flex that my wisdom totally outscores the devil's sneaky moves.
[3 Nephi 21:11] So here's the deal: anyone who ghosts my words...I'm Jesus Christ, btw...sent by the Father to drop truth to the Gentiles with mad power (just like Moses predicted), they're getting yeeted outta my squad, the covenant crew.
[3 Nephi 21:12] My remnant crew from Jacob will roll deep among the Gentiles, like a lion flexin' among forest beasts or young lion vibin' with sheep...when they move, they stomp and tear it up, and no one's sliding in to save the day.
[3 Nephi 21:13] Their squad's hand goes up flexin' on their haters, and all the enemies? Yeah, they get fully clapped.
[3 Nephi 21:14] Yo, bad news for the Gentiles if they don't repent; the Father's like, "I'm snatching your horses and smashing your chariots" when that day drops.
[3 Nephi 21:15] I'm gonna erase your cities and wreck all your strongholds...no cap.
[3 Nephi 21:16] I'm deleting all witchcraft from your turf, and those soothsayers? They're officially canceled.
[3 Nephi 21:17] I'm about to snip your idols and statues right outta your squad, so you won't be flexin' worship on stuff you made with your own hands anymore.
[3 Nephi 21:18] I'm pulling out your groves from the heart of your land, and on top of that, your cities are getting wrecked.
[3 Nephi 21:19] Real talk, all the lies, scams, envy vibes, drama, fake priest moves, and hookups gone wrong? They're getting totally deleted.
[3 Nephi 21:20] The Father says, when that day drops, if you don't repent and link up with my Beloved Son, you're getting yeeted from my people, House of Israel.
[3 Nephi 21:21] I'm about to drop savage vengeance and rage on them like the heathen never even heard of...straight fire, no cap.
[3 Nephi 21:22] But if they hit repent mode, vibe with my words, and don't stay salty, I'll set up my church with them, and they'll join the covenant squad...part of Jacob's remnant getting this land as their legit inheritance.
[3 Nephi 21:23] They'll squad up with my people, Jacob's remnant, plus any House of Israel peeps who roll through, to build a city flexing called New Jerusalem.
[3 Nephi 21:24] Then they'll help my scattered fam get pulled together from all over the map straight into New Jerusalem's crew.
[3 Nephi 21:25] Then heaven's power's gonna drop right among them, and I'll be chillin' right in the middle of it all.
[3 Nephi 21:26] Then the Father's grind kicks off big time when the gospel hits the remnant squad, and real talk, it'll roll out to all my scattered peeps...even the lost tribes the Father bounced from Jerusalem.
[3 Nephi 21:27] For real, the hustle starts with all my scattered fam, with the Father paving the path so they can hit me up and shout the Father's name.
[3 Nephi 21:28] For sure, the Father's hustle kicks off worldwide, setting up the route so his squad can finally pull up to their inheritance land.
[3 Nephi 21:29] They'll leave all nations, but no rush, no mad dash...'cause the Father's got their front and back, saying "I'm leading the way and covering their six."
[3 Nephi 22:1] Then the script hits: Yo barren one who never popped out kids, start singing loud...your squad's gonna outnumber the married crew, says the Lord.
[3 Nephi 22:2] Broaden your tent vibes, stretch those curtains wide; no cap, loosen up your ropes and tighten those stakes for real.
[3 Nephi 22:3] You'll pop off both sides, and your squad will claim the Gentiles' turf, turning ghost towns into lit cribs.
[3 Nephi 22:4] Don't catch feelings or get shook, you won't get dragged; you'll ghost all the old shame and clap back at every shame throw from your younger days and widow vibes.
[3 Nephi 22:5] Your maker and hubby is the Lord of Hosts...yeah, that's His name...and your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, flexing as the God of the whole earth.
[3 Nephi 22:6] The Lord's saying He called you out when you were feeling ghosted and low-key heartbroken, like a young wife who got ditched, says your God.
[3 Nephi 22:7] I dipped for a sec, no cap, but with mad mercy, I'm pulling you back in strong.
[3 Nephi 22:8] I low-key turned away in some quick anger, but my kindness is forever...I'll show mercy, says the Lord your Redeemer.
[3 Nephi 22:9] Like I swore the flood would never drown the earth again, I'm deadass swearing I won't be mad at you.
[3 Nephi 22:10] Even if mountains bounce and hills dip, my kindness stays glued to you, and my peace pact? Untouchable, says the Lord who's got your mercy.
[3 Nephi 22:11] Yo, you stressed and hit by storms with zero comfort? Watch me deck your stones in fresh colors and your foundations in sapphires, no cap.
[3 Nephi 22:12] I'll hook your windows with agates, your gates with carbuncles, and flex all your edges with straight-up fire stones.
[3 Nephi 22:13] All your kids will get schooled by the Lord Himself, so their peace levels gonna be mad high.
[3 Nephi 22:14] You'll be solid on righteousness, way away from any sus oppression...no fear here, and terror won't even slide close.
[3 Nephi 22:15] Heads up, folks gonna squad up on you...but not 'cause I'm sending them; anyone rolling up against you will get owned for your sake.
[3 Nephi 22:16] Look, I made the blacksmith pumping fire and crafting tools for his grind, and I also made the destroyer who wrecks stuff.
[3 Nephi 22:17] No weapon cooked up against you will flex; every shade-talking tongue thrown at you in court? You'll shut that down. That's the plug for God's crew, their righteous creds come straight from me, says the Lord.
[3 Nephi 23:1] Yo, for real, you gotta deep-dive into this stuff...straight up command: grind hard on Isaiah's words cuz they're majorly epic.
[3 Nephi 23:2] No cap, Isaiah was talking all about my peeps from Israel's squad, so obviously he had to throw some words for the Gentiles too.
[3 Nephi 23:3] Everything Isaiah said has already happened or will happen just like he said...no receipts needed, it's all facts.
[3 Nephi 23:4] So, listen up, jot down what I'm dropping, and when the Father's clock hits, these words will slide out to the Gentiles, say less.
[3 Nephi 23:5] Anyone who vibes with my words, flips the script by repenting and getting baptized, is set for salvation. Scope out the prophets...they're all on this wave too.
[3 Nephi 23:6] After Jesus schooled them on all the scriptures they had, He dropped, "Yo, there's more scriptures I want you to write down that you don't got yet."
[3 Nephi 23:7] Then Jesus told Nephi, "Pull up that record you been holding onto."
[3 Nephi 23:8] Nephi pulled out the records and laid them down, and Jesus scanned them before saying:
[3 Nephi 23:9] For real, I told my boy Samuel the Lamanite to flex to these people that when the Father hyped His name through me, loads of saints would bounce back from the dead, show up to many, and serve them. He asked, "Wasn't that the tea?"
[3 Nephi 23:10] His squad replied, "Bet, Lord, Samuel's prophecy was spot on and everything came through exactly how you said."
[3 Nephi 23:11] Jesus hit them with, "Wait, how come y'all didn't write down that many saints actually rose up, showed up, and served the people?"
[3 Nephi 23:12] Then Nephi low-key realized they hadn't put that part in the records yet.
[3 Nephi 23:13] Jesus straight up told them to write it down, so of course, they did...no cap, just like He said.
[3 Nephi 23:14] After Jesus broke down all the scriptures they had into one vibe, He told them to go teach everything He just schooled them on.
[3 Nephi 24:1] Jesus told them to jot down what the Father gave Malachi to say, then He broke it down for them: "The Father said, 'I'm sending my messenger to prep the way for me, and the Lord you're chasing will pull up to His temple outta nowhere...the messenger of the covenant you're hyped for; trust, He's coming,' says the Lord of Hosts."
[3 Nephi 24:2] But real talk, who can handle the day He rolls up, and who'll even stand when He shows? He's like that fire that melts impurities and soap that cleans deep.
[3 Nephi 24:3] He's gonna chill like a refiner cleaning silver, purifying the sons of Levi, purging them like gold and silver so they can flex righteous offerings to the Lord.
[3 Nephi 24:4] Then the offerings from Judah and Jerusalem will vibe with the Lord again, just like back in the day and OG times.
[3 Nephi 24:5] I'm rolling up for judgment, quick to expose sorcerers, cheaters, liars, bossing workers around, ignoring widows, orphans, and outsiders...and y'all better not be scared of Me, says the Lord of Hosts.
[3 Nephi 24:6] I'm the Lord, unchangeable no cap, so that's why you sons of Jacob haven't been wiped out.
[3 Nephi 24:7] Since your ancestors, y'all dipped from my rules and didn't stick to them. Pull up to Me, and I'll pull up to you, says the Lord of Hosts. But y'all hit back, "Okay, where exactly we supposed to return?"
[3 Nephi 24:8] For real, who tries to rob God? Yet y'all been straight-up robbing Me. And y'all be like, "Rob you? How?" In tithes and offerings, no cap.
[3 Nephi 24:9] Y'all got hit with a serious curse 'cause y'all robbed Me...like the whole nation's in the L.
[3 Nephi 24:10] Bring all the tithes to the storehouse so my house stays stacked; try Me on this, says the Lord of Hosts...I'll open heaven's windows and bless you so hard you won't have space to catch it all.
[3 Nephi 24:11] I'll clap back at the devourer for y'all, so it won't wreck your crops or make your vines drop fruit early in the fields, says the Lord of Hosts.
[3 Nephi 24:12] Every nation's gonna stan you 'cause you'll be hella blessed and a vibin' land, says the Lord of Hosts.
[3 Nephi 24:13] Y'all been throwing serious shade at Me, says the Lord. But then y'all hit back like, "What did we even say against You?"
[3 Nephi 24:14] Y'all been flexing that serving God is pointless, asking what's the gain in keeping His rules and dragging your feet before the Lord of Hosts.
[3 Nephi 24:15] Now y'all hype the proud like they're winners; the wicked get the clout; and even those testing God get saved...low-key wild.
[3 Nephi 24:16] So the ones who feared the Lord kept chatting among themselves, God was all ears, and a receipt book got logged for those who feared Him and kept His name popping in their minds.
[3 Nephi 24:17] They'll be Mine, says the Lord of Hosts, on the day I collect My jewels; and I'll protect them just like a dad guards his loyal son.
[3 Nephi 24:18] At that point, y'all will low-key see who's righteous and who's sus, who's serving God and who's just ghosting Him.
[3 Nephi 25:1] Bet, the day's coming like a blazing oven; all the proud and wicked will be nothing but stubble, burned up with no roots or branches left, says the Lord of Hosts.
[3 Nephi 25:2] But for y'all who respect My name, the Son of Righteousness will glow up with healing vibes under His wings; you'll bounce back and flex like calves in a stall.
[3 Nephi 25:3] Y'all will stomp out the wicked...they'll be straight-up ashes under your kicks on the day I make this happen, says the Lord of Hosts.
[3 Nephi 25:4] Don't forget the law I gave Moses, My servant, at Horeb for all Israel...rules and rulings all laid out, no cap.
[3 Nephi 25:5] Heads up, I'm sending Elijah the prophet your way before the big, scary Day of the Lord drops.
[3 Nephi 25:6] He's gonna flip the vibe, making fathers care for their kids and kids for their dads, or else I'll roll up and curse the whole earth, no cap.
[3 Nephi 26:1] So after Jesus dropped these facts, He broke it all down for the crowd...no cap, nothing too big or small left unexplained.
[3 Nephi 26:2] He said, "These scriptures you didn't have? The Father told me to hand them to y'all, 'cause He's smart and knows future generations need these receipts."
[3 Nephi 26:3] He broke down everything from day one up to His glorious comeback...no cap...including all the wild stuff coming to earth till elements melt like butter and the world rolls up like a scroll before skies and earth vanish.
[3 Nephi 26:4] Even up to the final showdown day when every person, crew, nation, and language will squad up before God to get judged on their deeds...good or sus.
[3 Nephi 26:5] If they're good, they bounce to eternal life; if evil, they hit resurrection damnation...split paths side by side, all balanced by the mercy, justice, and holiness in Christ, OG since before the world existed.
[3 Nephi 26:6] No cap, this book can't even hold a fraction of the real stuff Jesus schooled the people on.
[3 Nephi 26:7] But fr, Nephi's plates got most of the lessons Jesus dropped on the crowd.
[3 Nephi 26:8] I wrote these up...they're just a small slice of what He taught...so they can come back to y'all from the Gentiles, just like Jesus said.
[3 Nephi 26:9] Once they catch this first...real necessary for a faith check...if they vibe with it, bigger truths will get revealed to them.
[3 Nephi 26:10] But if they ghost these truths, the bigger stuff stays on lock, and that's on them...straight-up condemnation incoming.
[3 Nephi 26:11] Yo, I was ready to script everything from Nephi's plates, but the Lord was like, "Hold up, gotta test my people's faith first."
[3 Nephi 26:12] So yeah, I'm Mormon, just jotting down what the Lord told me. Wrapping up my part, now moving on to what He's commanding next.
[3 Nephi 26:13] So, peep this: the Lord schooled the people hard for three days straight, then flexed His presence on them often, breaking bread, blessing it, and handing it out like the main event.
[3 Nephi 26:14] So Jesus schooled the kids from the crowd, unlocked their tongues, and suddenly they were spilling mad wisdom to their dads...stuff even bigger than what He'd dropped on the people; He gave them full rizz to speak up.
[3 Nephi 26:15] After He bounced up to heaven the second time He showed up, having healed all their sick, fixed the lame, gave sight to the blind, opened deaf ears, pulled all kinds of heal flexes, raised a guy from the dead, showed serious power, then ascended to the Father...straight legendary.
[3 Nephi 26:16] Next day, the crowd rolled up and caught these kids...yeah, even babies...spitting straight fire; but peep this, nobody was allowed to write down their words.
[3 Nephi 26:17] From then on, Jesus' chosen squad started baptizing and schooling anyone who showed up; and everyone dunked in Jesus' name got filled up with the Holy Ghost, no cap.
[3 Nephi 26:18] Tons of them peeped and heard mad secret stuff too wild to get penned down anywhere.
[3 Nephi 26:19] They all schooled each other, served up that community vibe, sharing everything like true squad goals...everyone playing fair, no cap.
[3 Nephi 26:20] For real, they ran with everything exactly like Jesus told them to...no exceptions, just full send.
[3 Nephi 26:21] Anyone baptized in Jesus' name got dubbed the church of Christ...straight official.
[3 Nephi 27:1] So, Jesus' disciples were out there preaching what they'd seen and heard, baptizing in His name, then they linked up for some next-level prayer and fasting vibes, all united and focused.
[3 Nephi 27:2] While they were praying to the Father in Jesus' name, He popped up again, stood right in their circle, and hit them with, "What y'all want me to bless you with?"
[3 Nephi 27:3] They said, "Lord, just tell us the name we should rep for this church, 'cause people are low-key beefin' about it."
[3 Nephi 27:4] Jesus was like, "No cap, why y'all even stressing and arguing over this name drama?"
[3 Nephi 27:5] Didn't they peep the scriptures? It says you gotta rock the name of Christ...my name...and that's the tag you'll flex on Judgment Day.
[3 Nephi 27:6] Anyone who reps my name and keeps it 100 till the end? Bet...they'll get saved when the final day drops.
[3 Nephi 27:7] So basically, whatever you do, do it repping my name; name the church after me, and hit up the Father in my name to bless the church 'cause of me.
[3 Nephi 27:8] Like, how can it be my church if it ain't called by my name? If it's Moses' name, it's his squad; some dude's name, it's their crew. But call it by my name and it's *my* church...only if it's built on my gospel, no cap.
[3 Nephi 27:9] No cap, y'all are built on my gospel, so whatever you name, do it under my name; if you call on the Father for the church in my name, He's gonna hear you.
[3 Nephi 27:10] If the church's built on my gospel, the Father's gonna flex His own works through it, no doubt.
[3 Nephi 27:11] But if the church's built on human hustle or the devil's grind, they'll catch some fake joy for a bit...but soon the end hits, and they get chopped down and thrown into the fire with no bounce back.
[3 Nephi 27:12] Their own actions catch up with them, and that's why they get cut down...so remember what I told you, no cap.
[3 Nephi 27:13] Look, I handed y'all my gospel...that I came into this world to flex my Father's will, 'cause He sent me, say less.
[3 Nephi 27:14] My Father sent me to get lifted on the cross, and after that, to pull everyone toward me...just like I got lifted by people, y'all gotta get lifted by the Father to face me and get judged on your deeds, good or sus.
[3 Nephi 27:15] That's why I got lifted...so with the Father's power, I pull everyone to me to face judgment based on their own vibes, no cap.
[3 Nephi 27:16] For real, whoever repents and gets baptized in my name gets filled up; if they stick it out till the end, I'll flex on the Father and say they're guiltless when I judge the world.
[3 Nephi 27:17] But if you don't hold up till the end, you're straight-up getting chopped down and tossed in the fire with zero chances to bounce back...Father's justice is real.
[3 Nephi 27:18] This is the word He dropped for all humans, and He's all about fulfilling His promises...no cap, He never lies, just keeps it 100 on every word.
[3 Nephi 27:19] No sus stuff gets into His kingdom; only those who've soaked their robes in my blood...thanks to faith, repentance, and sticking it out till the end...can chill in His rest.
[3 Nephi 27:20] Here's the command: Repent, everyone from every corner, come to me and get baptized in my name, so the Holy Ghost can clean you up and you can flex spotless before me on judgment day.
[3 Nephi 27:21] No cap, this is my gospel; you already know the moves to make in my church...do the same stuff you've seen me pull off, straight up copy my vibe.
[3 Nephi 27:22] So if you're out here doing these things, big blessing incoming...you'll get lifted up on the last day, no doubt.
[3 Nephi 27:23] Write down the stuff you've seen and heard, but skip the things that're off-limits, say less.
[3 Nephi 27:24] Jot down the moves this squad will make, 'cause it's gonna replay what's already been written about the past, no cap.
[3 Nephi 27:25] Heads up: this crew will get judged based on the books already written and the ones yet to drop, since their actions get exposed through them, no cap.
[3 Nephi 27:26] FYI, the Father wrote all this stuff, so the world's gonna get judged based on the books still to come, straight facts.
[3 Nephi 27:27] Know this: you'll be the judges of this crew, using the fair judgment I hand down. So what kinda humans should you be? Deadass, just like me.
[3 Nephi 27:28] Now I'm bouncing to the Father, and no cap, whatever you ask Him in my name, you're getting it.
[3 Nephi 27:29] So, ask up and you'll get served; knock and doors will swing wide...anyone who asks gets, anyone who knocks gets in, no cap.
[3 Nephi 27:30] Low-key, my joy is maxed out 'cause of you and this whole generation; even the Father and all the holy angels are hyped, 'cause no one's been lost.
[3 Nephi 27:31] Look, I want you to get it...I'm talkin' 'bout the folks alive right now in this generation, none are lost, and they're the reason I'm full-on joyful.
[3 Nephi 27:32] But real talk, the fourth gen after this one hits me with mad sadness 'cause they'll get snatched like the son of perdition; they'll sell me for silver, gold, and junk that rots or gets stolen. When that day comes, I'm gonna hit 'em back hard, making their own moves boomerang right onto them.
[3 Nephi 27:33] When Jesus finished, He told His squad: Slide through the tight gate...it's narrow but leads to life, and not many find it; meanwhile, the big, wide gate heads to death and tons roll that way, until night drops and no one's grinding anymore.
[3 Nephi 28:1] After Jesus dropped those words, He hit up His disciples one-on-one like, "What y'all want from me once I dip to the Father?"
[3 Nephi 28:2] Everyone clapped back, except three, saying: We want our time on earth to run its course and our calling to end, so we can flex into Your kingdom ASAP.
[3 Nephi 28:3] Jesus said, Bet, you're blessed for wanting that; once you hit 72, you'll roll up to me in my kingdom and catch that rest with me.
[3 Nephi 28:4] After that, He switched focus to the three and asked, "What's the move? What should I do for y'all when I bounce to the Father?"
[3 Nephi 28:5] They low-key felt sad inside 'cause they were too shook to say what they really wanted.
[3 Nephi 28:6] Jesus was like, I got you...I know your thoughts, and you're craving the same thing John, my OG homie from the ministry days before the Jews lifted me up, asked for.
[3 Nephi 28:7] So you're even more blessed, no cap...you won't ever taste death; you'll live long enough to see all the Father's moves with humanity until everything's done right, and I pull up in glory with heaven's full power.
[3 Nephi 28:8] You won't have to deal with death's pain; when I show up in glory, you'll flip from mortal to immortal in a blink, then you're gonna be blessed big time in my Father's kingdom.
[3 Nephi 28:9] Plus, no pain or grief while you're still rocking the flesh...only feels for the world's sins...and I'm doing all this 'cause you asked to bring souls to me as long as the world spins.
[3 Nephi 28:10] So, you're gonna have max joy and chill in my Father's kingdom; your happiness will be lit, just like the Father handed me full-on joy; you'll be just like me, and I'm just like the Father; we're basically one squad.
[3 Nephi 28:11] The Holy Ghost ships the vibe between the Father and me, and the Father drops the Holy Ghost to people all 'cause of me.
[3 Nephi 28:12] After Jesus said all that, he tapped each of them with his finger...except the three meant to stay...and then he dipped.
[3 Nephi 28:13] Then the skies popped open, and they got snatched up into heaven, peeping and hearing stuff beyond words.
[3 Nephi 28:14] But straight up, they weren't allowed to spill the tea or had the juice to even share what they saw and heard.
[3 Nephi 28:15] They couldn't even vibe if they were in or out the body; felt like they got glow-ups, switching from flesh to immortal mode so they could peep God's stuff.
[3 Nephi 28:16] Then they went back to serving on earth, but low-key stayed silent about what they saw and heard 'cause heaven dropped the rule to keep it hush.
[3 Nephi 28:17] Real talk, since their glow-up day, I got no clue if they're still mortal or fully immortal.
[3 Nephi 28:18] Here's what I know from the record...they cruised the land, preaching and linking up believers to the church; they baptized folks, and everyone dunked got the Holy Ghost hookup.
[3 Nephi 28:19] They got thrown in jail by haters outside the church, but the cells couldn't hold...they legit ripped those bars in half.
[3 Nephi 28:20] They got tossed underground, but they smacked the earth with God's word so hard they broke free by His power; no hole was deep enough to lock them down.
[3 Nephi 28:21] They got tossed into the fire three times straight and came out untouched...total invincibility flex.
[3 Nephi 28:22] Twice they got dropped into a den of wild beasts, but no cap, they vibed with the animals like kids with baby lambs...came out zero damage.
[3 Nephi 28:23] So they rolled through all Nephi, preaching Christ's gospel to everyone, converting peeps, linking them up with Christ's church, and that gen got blessed big time, no cap, just like Jesus said.
[3 Nephi 28:24] Alright, I'm Mormon, and I'm wrapping up this chat about these things for now...say less.
[3 Nephi 28:25] So, I was ready to drop the names of those who'd never die, but the Lord said nah, so I'm keeping it on the DL...names cloaked from the world.
[3 Nephi 28:26] Low-key, I've seen them myself, and they've been serving me straight up.
[3 Nephi 28:27] Bet, they'll be chilling among the Gentiles, but no cap, the Gentiles won't even recognize them.
[3 Nephi 28:28] They'll be vibing with the Jews too, but fr, the Jews won't even peep who they are.
[3 Nephi 28:29] When God's timing's right, they'll flex their ministry to all Israel's scattered tribes and every nation, language, and squad, pulling mad souls to Jesus...making their wish come true with God's undeniable power in them.
[3 Nephi 28:30] They're basically angel-level, and if they pray to the Father in Jesus' name, they can flex by showing up to anyone they want, no cap.
[3 Nephi 28:31] So, they're gonna pull off epic, next-level miracles before that big day when everyone gotta face Christ's judgment no cap.
[3 Nephi 28:32] For real, even the Gentiles will witness some insane, awe-worthy stuff from them before judgment day rolls up.
[3 Nephi 28:33] If you had all the scriptures spilling tea on Christ's epic works, you'd low-key know these things gotta happen, no cap, just like Jesus said.
[3 Nephi 28:34] Big W if you ignore Jesus' words and the squad He sent...reject their message, you're basically ghosting Him, and trust, you won't get the hookup on judgment day.
[3 Nephi 28:35] Deadass, it'd be better if they were never born. Think you can dodge the wrath of an offended God, who's been stepped on by humans just so salvation could drop? Nah, no way.
[3 Nephi 28:36] So yeah, about those three the Lord picked and snatched up to heaven...I wasn't even sure if they leveled up from mortal to immortal, no cap.
[3 Nephi 28:37] But fr, after writing that, I hit up the Lord, and He clapped back...said their bodies gotta switch up or they gotta face death, no cap.
[3 Nephi 28:38] So to dodge death, their bodies got that glow-up...no pain, no sorrow, except when repping the world's sins.
[3 Nephi 28:39] This glow-up wasn't the final boss level like at the last day, but it was lit enough that Satan had zero clout...no temptations stick, they stayed holy AF in the flesh, and no earthly powers could cage them.
[3 Nephi 28:40] They stayed like that till Christ's big judgment drop, then leveled up even harder and got the VIP pass into the Father's kingdom to chill with God forever, no cap.
[3 Nephi 29:1] Listen up, when the Lord's ready and vibes with it, these words will hit the Gentiles like He said, then you'll know the Father's promise to Israel about their comeback to their land is already kicking off.
[3 Nephi 29:2] You can bet the Lord's words, dropped by the holy prophets, will all come through...so don't even start with "God's taking forever" on showing up for Israel.
[3 Nephi 29:3] Don't get it twisted thinking the spoken words are empty...God's got receipts and will never forget His promise to the house of Israel, no cap.
[3 Nephi 29:4] When these words start popping up around you, stop clowning on God's moves...His justice sword is ready to swing, and if you keep disrespecting, it'll catch you quick, no cap.
[3 Nephi 29:5] Big yikes for anyone dissing God's moves, and extra big L for those who deny Christ and His grind!
[3 Nephi 29:6] Deadass, major woah to anyone who says God's done dropping revelations, prophecies, gifts, tongues, healings, or Holy Ghost power...like, say less, that's straight cap.
[3 Nephi 29:7] And fr, big woah to anyone out here flexing for clout, saying Jesus can't pull miracles; that vibe got you walking like the son of perdition...no mercy, straight facts from Christ's playbook.
[3 Nephi 29:8] No more throwing shade or clowning on the Jews or Israel's remnant; God's got their back and He's about to keep every promise He swore.
[3 Nephi 29:9] Don't think you can switch up God's right hand to His left and dodge the judgment He's gotta drop to keep His promise to Israel...say less on that.
[3 Nephi 30:1] Yo Gentiles, listen up to Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God...He told me to spill these truths about you, and straight up made me write this down, so here we go:
[3 Nephi 30:2] Gentiles, for real, ditch your toxic ways...stop the lies, cheats, wild sins, shady secrets, idol worship, kills, fake priest moves, jealousy, beefs, and all that mess; come through, get baptized in my name, and cop that sin wipe plus Holy Ghost vibes, so you flex with God's people from Israel.
[4 Nephi 1:1] So, years 34 and 35 slid by, and Jesus' squad built up a church everywhere nearby; anyone who rolled up, truly flipped the script on their sins, got baptized in Jesus' name, and caught that Holy Ghost energy.
[4 Nephi 1:2] By year 36, everyone...Nephites and Lamanites...was fully converted to the Lord, no cap; no beefs or drama, just straight-up fairness and respect everywhere.
[4 Nephi 1:3] They shared everything like squad goals...no rich, no poor, no slaves, no free agents...just all freed up and vibing on that heavenly gift together.
[4 Nephi 1:4] Year 37 slid by too, and the peace vibe just kept flexing hard across the land.
[4 Nephi 1:5] Jesus' disciples were pulling mad miracles...healing the sick, raising the dead, getting lame folks walking, giving sight to the blind, and hearing to the deaf...no cap, all done flexing Jesus' name.
[4 Nephi 1:6] Years 38, 39, 41, 42, all the way to 49, then 51, 52, up to 59...they all slid past like clockwork, no cap.
[4 Nephi 1:7] The Lord blessed them big time...they rebuilt cities that had been straight-up burned down, no cap.
[4 Nephi 1:8] For real, they even reconstructed the legendary city Zarahemla from the ashes.
[4 Nephi 1:9] But yo, a bunch of cities got straight-up sunk, replaced by water, so no glow-up for those spots, sadly.
[4 Nephi 1:10] Peep this: Nephi's crew blew up in numbers mad quick and leveled up to be a super fresh and glow-up squad.
[4 Nephi 1:11] They tied the knot and got hooked up, stacking blessings straight from all the Lord's promises...no cap.
[4 Nephi 1:12] They ditched the old Moses rituals and flexed the commandments from their Lord, grinding in fasting, prayer, and squad meetups to vibe with His word.
[4 Nephi 1:13] No cap, zero beef anywhere in the land, just mad miracles popping off through Jesus' disciples.
[4 Nephi 1:14] Years 71 through 79 slid by, then a whole century passed; Jesus' OG disciples all bounced to paradise except three holdouts, replaced by fresh disciples while many from that gen dipped.
[4 Nephi 1:15] No drama anywhere 'cause God's love was vibing hard in everyone's hearts, straight up.
[4 Nephi 1:16] No cap, no envy, fights, chaos, cheating, lies, murders, or sketchy behavior...these folks were the happiest crew God ever made, no contest.
[4 Nephi 1:17] No robbers, no killers, no Lamanites or any -ites drama; just one squad...Christ's kids and heirs to God's kingdom, say less.
[4 Nephi 1:18] They were mad blessed, fr...they thrived in everything for 110 years straight; Christ's OG crew had dipped, and peace was locked down everywhere.
[4 Nephi 1:19] So Nephi, the last recorder holding it down on the plates of Nephi, passed away, and his son Amos took over the drip, keeping it fresh on the same plates.
[4 Nephi 1:20] Amos held the record for 84 years; peace was mostly chill except a minor crew went rogue, repping Lamanites again and stirring up some vibes.
[4 Nephi 1:21] Amos died too, 194 years after Christ showed up, and his son Amos took the record grind, still rocking the plates of Nephi...yeah, this very book right here.
[4 Nephi 1:22] Two hundred years slid by, and the second gen was mostly gone, just a few left holding it down.
[4 Nephi 1:23] Yo, it's Mormon here...people blew up big time, spread all over the land, flexin' mad riches thanks to their glow-up in Christ.
[4 Nephi 1:24] So, in year 201, some peeps started getting extra with pride...rocking boujee fits, pearls, and all the flashy flexes from the world.
[4 Nephi 1:25] From then on, their stuff and wealth stopped being shared like before...everyone started guarding their flex solo.
[4 Nephi 1:26] They started clout-chasing, making cliques and building their own churches for the bag, low-key dissing the real Church of Christ.
[4 Nephi 1:27] By year 210, churches were popping everywhere; lots claimed to know Christ but ghosted most of his gospel, letting all kinds of wickedness slide and handing sacred stuff to straight-up unworthy peeps.
[4 Nephi 1:28] This fake church blew up big time, all thanks to their sins and Satan low-key snatching their hearts like it was a takeover.
[4 Nephi 1:29] Then there was another crew who straight-up denied Christ and went full savage on the true Church 'cause of their humble vibes and faith, hating on them for all the miracles they flexed.
[4 Nephi 1:30] So these haters flexed power over Jesus' disciples chilling with them and threw them in jail; but no cap, God's word had their back, busted the prisons wide open, and boom...they went out doing mad miracles.
[4 Nephi 1:31] Even with all those wild miracles, people still got heartless and tried to off them...same move the Jews pulled on Jesus in Jerusalem, just like he said would happen.
[4 Nephi 1:32] They threw them into fiery furnaces, but these legends walked out totally unscathed...no cap.
[4 Nephi 1:33] They tossed them in with wild beasts, but these champs played with the animals like kids with lambs and bounced out without a scratch.
[4 Nephi 1:34] Still, folks stayed heartless, getting played by fake priests and prophets who pumped up churches for sinning hard. They clapped at Jesus' crew, but Jesus' peeps kept it 100 and didn't clap back. So unbelief and wickedness kept growing year after year until year 230 rolled in.
[4 Nephi 1:35] Then year 231 hit, and suddenly the squad split hard...major division vibes everywhere.
[4 Nephi 1:36] So in that same year, a new crew called the Nephites popped up, real ones riding with Christ; and among them were groups named Jacobites, Josephites, and Zoramites by the Lamanites.
[4 Nephi 1:37] So the real Christ stans and worshippers, including the three OG disciples sticking around, got tagged as Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, and Zoramites.
[4 Nephi 1:38] Meanwhile, the ones who ghosted the gospel got called Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites; they didn't just lose faith, they full-on rebelled and schooled their kids to doubt just like their ancestors did from day one.
[4 Nephi 1:39] All this mess traced back to their parents' toxic vibes from the jump, and they got schooled to hate God's kids just like the Lamanites were taught to hate Nephi's crew from day one.
[4 Nephi 1:40] Fast forward 244 years, and that's the tea on the people's drama: the bad squad got way more clout and way bigger than God's crew, no cap.
[4 Nephi 1:41] They kept flexing, building churches for themselves and decking them out with all the shiny stuff, and this vibe lasted through 250 and even 260 years.
[4 Nephi 1:42] Then the bad crew started cooking up those sus secret oaths and Gadianton combos all over again.
[4 Nephi 1:43] And even Nephi's crew caught major pride vibes from their mad riches and started flexing just like their Lamanite cousins...straight up vain energy.
[4 Nephi 1:44] From then on, the disciples caught deep feels, low-key grieving over the world's epic sin spree.
[4 Nephi 1:45] After 300 years, Nephi's crew and the Lamanites both hit peak wickedness, basically twinning in bad vibes.
[4 Nephi 1:46] The Gadianton robbers went full pandemic, spreading everywhere; only Jesus' disciples stayed righteous, while everyone else was stacking mad gold and silver and hustling all kinds of shady deals.
[4 Nephi 1:47] After 305 years of the squad staying sus, Amos dipped out, and his bro Ammaron took over keeping the receipts.
[4 Nephi 1:48] By year 320, Ammaron got the Holy Ghost vibes and low-key stashed all the sacred records everybody had been passing down since day one, keeping that holy info on lock.
[4 Nephi 1:49] He tucked those records away for the Lord, waiting for them to hit up Jacob's remnant as promised...prophecies on deck. And that's a wrap on Ammaron's record.
[Mormon 1:1] Yo, it's Mormon here, dropping my own record of all the tea I've seen and heard...calling it the Book of Mormon, say less.
[Mormon 1:2] Around when Ammaron stashed the records, he rolled up to me...was just ten, learning my people's ways...and told me, "You're low-key mature and sharp AF."
[Mormon 1:3] So, when you hit 24, remember all the receipts you've peeped about these folks, then slide over to Antum, to a hill named Shim, where I've dropped all the sacred engravings for the Lord.
[Mormon 1:4] Bet, grab the plates of Nephi for yourself, leave the rest where they chill, and carve into Nephi's plates everything you've noticed about these people.
[Mormon 1:5] So yeah, I'm Mormon, straight outta Nephi's fam, my dad's Mormon too, and I didn't forget a single thing Ammaron told me to do.
[Mormon 1:6] When I was just eleven, my dad hauled me down south to Zarahemla...no cap, that's where we landed.
[Mormon 1:7] The land was straight-up packed with buildings everywhere, and the people? Almost as many as the grains of sand by the sea...mad crowd energy.
[Mormon 1:8] That year, war popped off with the Nephites squad...Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, Zoramites...beefin' against the Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites. Straight-up clan clash.
[Mormon 1:9] The Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites all got the Lamanite tag, so basically it was just two squads: Nephites vs. Lamanites.
[Mormon 1:10] So the war kicked off right on Zarahemla's edge, by the Sidon River...drama by the water, no chill.
[Mormon 1:11] The Nephites squad pulled up with over 30,000 strong, and that year they threw down in multiple battles, straight up clapping the Lamanites and taking out mad of them.
[Mormon 1:12] Then the Lamanites backed off their plans, peace dropped in the land, and for about four years it was all chill with zero bloodshed.
[Mormon 1:13] But real talk, evil ran wild everywhere, so God pulled his fave disciples, and the miracles and healings straight up stopped 'cause the people went full sus with sin.
[Mormon 1:14] No gifts from God were hitting, and the Holy Ghost ghosted everyone thanks to their wicked vibes and straight-up unbelief.
[Mormon 1:15] At fifteen, with my head kinda clear, God slid through and I got a taste of Jesus' goodness...real talk, I knew it was straight fire.
[Mormon 1:16] I tried to preach to the crowd, but my mouth got clamped shut...no cap, I was straight-up banned since they chosen to rebel hard against God, and His fave disciples bounced from the land 'cause of their sins.
[Mormon 1:17] I stayed put, but preaching was a no-go 'cause their hearts were mad hard; and because of that stubbornness, the land got cursed thanks to them.
[Mormon 1:18] Those Gadianton robbers chilling with the Lamanites messed up the land so bad folks had to hide their treasure underground; everything got hella slippery 'cause God cursed the land, making it impossible to keep their stuff safe.
[Mormon 1:19] Then all kinda sorcery, witchcraft, and dark magic popped off, with evil's influence taking over the whole land, straight up making Abinadi's and Samuel the Lamanite's prophecies come true, no cap.
[Mormon 2:1] That same year, war flared back up between Nephites and Lamanites; even though I was young, I was built big, so the Nephites picked me as their top dog, running their armies with main-character energy.
[Mormon 2:2] So, at sixteen, I rolled out leading the Nephite army against the Lamanites...meanwhile, 326 years had already dipped into the past.
[Mormon 2:3] Then in year 327, the Lamanites rolled up flexing mad power, scaring my troops so bad they dipped and started retreating north...no cap, they weren't about that fight life.
[Mormon 2:4] We pulled up to Angola, snagged the city, and prepped to hold it down against the Lamanites; we beefed up defenses hard, but still those Lamanites rolled in and straight-up kicked us out.
[Mormon 2:5] They also flexed on us and forced us outta the land of David...no chill at all.
[Mormon 2:6] We marched up and landed in the land of Joshua, right on the west side by the seashore...location on point.
[Mormon 2:7] We low-key rounded up our squad as fast as we could, tryna get everyone squad-deep in one place.
[Mormon 2:8] But fr, the land was packed with robbers and Lamanites, and even with all the chaos hitting my people, they stayed sus and didn't repent; so blood and carnage were everywhere...Nephites and Lamanites both caught in one massive, savage revolution across the land.
[Mormon 2:9] So the Lamanites had a king named Aaron who rolled up with 44,000 troops; I showed up with 42,000 and low-key smashed him, making him ghost before me...all this went down after 330 years had passed.
[Mormon 2:10] Then the Nephites finally started clapping back against their sins, crying out like Samuel the prophet said they would, 'cause no one could hold onto anything with thieves, robbers, murderers, magic, and witchcraft running wild all over the place.
[Mormon 2:11] So, mad mourning and lamenting spread everywhere, especially hitting the Nephi crew harder than the rest of the land.
[Mormon 2:12] When I, Mormon, peeped their tears and sorrow going up to the Lord, my heart low-key vibed with joy, knowing God's mad patience and mercy, hoping they'd bounce back as a righteous squad.
[Mormon 2:13] But fr, my hype was L; their crying wasn't real repentance fueled by God's kindness...it was more like the sad tears of the doomed, 'cause God ain't letting them vibe in sin forever.
[Mormon 2:14] Instead of rolling up to Jesus with broken hearts and humble vibes, they cursed God and low-key wished to die, yet still clutched their swords tight, fighting tooth and nail to stay alive.
[Mormon 2:15] My sorrow hit me again hard when I saw their chance for grace was straight up gone, both IRL and spiritually; thousands fell chopped down for rebelling against God, piled like trash across the land...this all went down over 344 years.
[Mormon 2:16] So in year 345, the Nephites started booking it from the Lamanites, who chased them all the way to the land of Jashon...no cap, they couldn't even put the brakes on that retreat.
[Mormon 2:17] So Jashon was close to where Ammaron stashed the records with the Lord to keep them safe, and yep, I followed Ammaron's instructions, grabbed the plates of Nephi, and started my own record just like he said.
[Mormon 2:18] I loaded the plates of Nephi with the full tea on all the wickedness and abominations, but on these plates, I held back 'cause honestly, nonstop evil's been on my feed ever since I could even peep human ways.
[Mormon 2:19] Low-key, I'm cursed by their wickedness; my heart's been heavy with sorrow every day, but fr, I know I'll get my glow-up on the last day.
[Mormon 2:20] That year, the Nephites got hunted down and pushed again, and we had to bounce all the way north up to the land called Shem.
[Mormon 2:21] We leveled up the city of Shem's defenses and pulled in our crew as tight as possible, hoping to save them from getting wiped out.
[Mormon 2:22] By year 346, they started rolling up on us again, no chill.
[Mormon 2:23] I hit up my people hard, hyping them to flex big energy and stand tall against the Lamanites, fighting to protect their wives, kids, cribs, and homes.
[Mormon 2:24] My speech did spark some serious vibe check; they didn't dip from the Lamanites but held their ground with mad boldness.
[Mormon 2:25] We threw down with 30K against their 50K, but we stood so solid they ended up ghosting us.
[Mormon 2:26] After they dipped, we chased with our troops, caught up again, and clapped them; but no cap, God's strength dipped from us, Spirit bounced, so we ended up weak like our bros.
[Mormon 2:27] My heart was straight-up heavy over my people's mad disaster from their wickedness and messed-up acts, but we still rolled out against the Lamanites and Gadianton robbers, snagging back our inherited lands.
[Mormon 2:28] Year 349 was done, and by 350, we struck a deal with the Lamanites and Gadianton robbers, splitting up our inherited lands like grown-ups.
[Mormon 2:29] The Lamanites handed us the land up north, all the way to the narrow pass leading south, and we gave them everything south of that...fair trade, no cap.
[Mormon 3:1] No battle from the Lamanites for ten years straight, and I had the Nephites low-key grinding, prepping their lands and upgrading their gear for the next throwdown.
[Mormon 3:2] Then God hit me with the message: Tell the squad to repent, slide back to Him, get baptized, rebuild His church, and they'll catch that rescue move.
[Mormon 3:3] I yelled at the crew, but it was all cap...they didn't even get that God saved them and gave a second shot to repent, and low-key, they just hardened their hearts against Him.
[Mormon 3:4] After year ten wrapped, making 360 since Christ showed up, the Lamanite king slid into my DMs with a message...heads up, they were gearing up to throw down again.
[Mormon 3:5] So I told my people to squad up at Desolation, a city chillin' by the narrow pass leading south...prime spot for the upcoming showdown.
[Mormon 3:6] We dropped our armies there to block the Lamanites, no way they'd snag our lands, so we flexed with full-on fort vibes, no cap.
[Mormon 3:7] Year 361, Lamanites rolled up to Desolation ready to beef, but we clapped back hard, making them dip straight back to their turf.
[Mormon 3:8] Year 362, Lamanites tried round two, but we dunked on them again, took out mad numbers, and tossed their bodies into the sea...facts only.
[Mormon 3:9] After the Nephites' epic W, they started flexing hard, swearing on the heavens they'd get revenge for their fallen bros...mad rizz, but a little toxic pride.
[Mormon 3:10] They swore on the heavens and God's throne they'd slide into battle and wipe their enemies off the map, no mercy, full send.
[Mormon 3:11] From that moment, I, Mormon, dipped from being their commander...too much sus wickedness and pure abomination to deal with, say less.
[Mormon 3:12] Look, I led them through mad battles despite their wicked vibes, loved them like God does, prayed all day for them...but no cap, it was all wasted effort 'cause their hearts were straight-up stone.
[Mormon 3:13] I saved them from their enemies three times, but they still didn't quit their sins...low-key ungrateful.
[Mormon 3:14] After swearing on everything Jesus forbid, they vowed to battle and get revenge for their fallen bros, then the Lord hit me up with a message, no cap.
[Mormon 3:15] The Lord said, "Vengeance is mine, I got the receipts, and since these folks didn't repent after I saved them, they're doomed to be wiped off the map."
[Mormon 3:16] I straight-up declined to fight my enemies, did exactly what the Lord said, and just stood back as a chill witness to show the world the visions and receipts the Spirit dropped about what's coming.
[Mormon 3:17] So I'm texting y'all Gentiles and the house of Israel: when the work kicks off, be ready to bounce back to your OG homeland, no cap.
[Mormon 3:18] Yo, sending this to all corners of the earth, twelve tribes of Israel included...you'll get judged on your deeds by the twelve squad Jesus handpicked back in Jerusalem, no cap.
[Mormon 3:19] Also dropping this to the leftover crew here, y'all gonna get judged by the twelve Jesus picked locally and the twelve he chose in Jerusalem...double the receipts.
[Mormon 3:20] The Spirit's spilling the tea to me, so I'm writing to y'all: every soul from Adam's fam gotta face Christ's judgment seat, no cap, where your deeds...good or sus...are called out.
[Mormon 3:21] Also, so y'all believe the Jesus gospel dropping among you, and the Jews...the Lord's squad...get extra receipts beyond what they saw and heard, proving Jesus, whom they killed, is the real Christ and God, no cap.
[Mormon 3:22] Wish I could convince everyone on this planet to turn their vibe around and get ready to face Christ's judgment, no cap.
[Mormon 4:1] So in year 363, the Nephites rolled up with their armies to throw down against the Lamanites, coming straight outta the land of Desolation.
[Mormon 4:2] The Nephite armies got pushed back to Desolation, still tired AF, then a new Lamanite squad ambushed 'em hard; they snatched the city, clapped many Nephites, and snatched a bunch of prisoners...straight savage.
[Mormon 4:3] The leftover Nephites dipped and linked up with the folks in Teancum, a city chillin' on the seashore right next to Desolation, no cap.
[Mormon 4:4] The Nephites went at the Lamanites first, so that's why they started catching W's; if not, the Lamanites wouldn't have had a shot over them, no cap.
[Mormon 4:5] Watch out, 'cause God's judgments catch wicked peeps; wickedness fights wickedness, since it's the bad apples who hype up everyone else for straight-up violence.
[Mormon 4:6] So the Lamanites started gearing up to roll on the city of Teancum, ready to throw hands.
[Mormon 4:7] In year 364, the Lamanites rolled up on Teancum trying to snatch that city for themselves too, no cap.
[Mormon 4:8] But the Nephites clapped back, pushing the Lamanites hard, flexed on their own power, then rolled out and snagged back the city of Desolation like bosses.
[Mormon 4:9] After all that chaos, thousands were dead on both sides...Nephites and Lamanites caught L's alike.
[Mormon 4:10] Year 366 rolled by, and the Lamanites swung at the Nephites again, but the Nephites stayed mad sus, no repentance...just doubling down on their bad vibes, fr.
[Mormon 4:11] No cap, words or writing can't fully capture the savage bloodbath between Nephites and Lamanites, 'cause everybody's heart was so cold they low-key vibed on nonstop violence.
[Mormon 4:12] Straight up, no crew from Lehi's fam or all Israel hit this level of wickedness before, said the Lord, and these peeps took that crown, big sus.
[Mormon 4:13] So the Lamanites snagged Desolation city, 'cause they straight-up outnumbered the Nephites...numbers don't lie, no cap.
[Mormon 4:14] They rolled up on Teancum next, kicked out the folks living there, snatched a bunch of women and kids as prisoners, then sacrificed them to their idol gods...mad evil, no debate.
[Mormon 4:15] Year 367, Nephites caught mad rage after Lamanites sacrificed their women and kids, so they went full beast mode, clapping the Lamanites and kicking them off their turf.
[Mormon 4:16] The Lamanites stayed ghost for a minute, not pulling up on the Nephites again until year 375 rolled around.
[Mormon 4:17] That year, they slid on the Nephites full force, squad so huge it was impossible to count...not even close to a flex.
[Mormon 4:18] From then on, Nephites lost all clout over the Lamanites and started getting wiped out like morning dew facing the sun...straight-up powerless.
[Mormon 4:19] The Lamanites rolled up on Desolation city again, and the fight was savage AF...ended with the Nephites getting straight-up clapped in Desolation land.
[Mormon 4:20] They dipped from the fight and bounced to Boaz city, where they flexed mad boldness against the Lamanites...so much that the Lamanites only took the W after round two.
[Mormon 4:21] When the Lamanites came back for round two, they clapped the Nephites hard, killing mad people, and once again sacrificed their women and kids to idols...straight-up brutal vibes.
[Mormon 4:22] So the Nephites bounced again, hauling all their people...towns and villages alike...trying to escape the Lamanite takeover.
[Mormon 4:23] Seeing the Lamanites about to flex hard and take over, I, Mormon, dipped to hill Shim and grabbed all the records Ammaron had stashed up safe for the Lord.
[Mormon 5:1] I rolled back to the Nephites, low-key regretting that oath where I ghosted them, and they gave me the army's reins again 'cause they were convinced I had the rizz to save them from all the chaos.
[Mormon 5:2] But real talk, I was hopeless because I knew God's judgment was coming...they weren't repenting, just clawing for survival without even hitting up the One who made them.
[Mormon 5:3] The Lamanites showed up chasing us at Jordan city, but we clapped back and kept them from snagging the city that day.
[Mormon 5:4] They swung back at us again, but we held down the city; plus, other Nephite strongholds blocked them so hard they couldn't crash the lands in front to ruin our people's turf.
[Mormon 5:5] But real talk, any land we skipped and didn't pull our people into got wrecked by the Lamanites...towns, villages, cities all burned up...and this savage cycle went on for 379 years straight.
[Mormon 5:6] In year 380, the Lamanites rolled up again, and though we stood bold, no cap, it was useless...they had mad numbers and straight-up stomped the Nephites underfoot.
[Mormon 5:7] We dipped again, and the only ones who made it were those faster than the Lamanites; the slower crew got clapped and wiped out.
[Mormon 5:8] Yo, I, Mormon, ain't trying to mess up your soul by dumping this crazy bloodbath I witnessed, but I know the receipts gotta come out...no cap, what's hidden will get flexed loud and clear.
[Mormon 5:9] Plus, this knowledge has to reach the leftover crew and the Gentiles who God said would scatter us, making us seem like nothing to them...so I'm dropping a short summary, not the full tea, 'cause I'm told to, and also so y'all don't catch too big an L from all the wickedness I've seen.
[Mormon 5:10] So, heads up to their fam and the Gentiles who vibe with Israel's squad...know for real where your blessings are coming from, no cap.
[Mormon 5:11] I know these peeps will catch major feels over Israel's wreckage; they'll be shook about our downfall and mad that we didn't repent so Jesus could've had us in a tight embrace.
[Mormon 5:12] These words go to Jacob's leftovers, written like this 'cause God's clued in that wickedness won't bless them; so they're on lockdown with Him till the perfect moment to drop.
[Mormon 5:13] This is the order I got: these things will pop up when the Lord flexes His wisdom and says the time's right, no cap.
[Mormon 5:14] Yo, these words will hit the unbelieving Jews to convince them Jesus is the Christ, God's Son, so the Father can flex His eternal plan by restoring Israel to their OG land and make His promise pop off.
[Mormon 5:15] Also, so this crew's descendants vibe harder with His gospel dropping from the Gentiles; 'cause these folks will get scattered and turn into a low-key nasty, ugly mess, worse than even the Lamanites... all 'cause they chose unbelief and idolatry, no cap.
[Mormon 5:16] Real talk, the Lord's Spirit dipped from dealing with their dads; they're now Christ- and God-less in the world, just getting tossed around like chaff in the wind, no rizz.
[Mormon 5:17] They used to be a top-tier squad, with Christ as their main shepherd and straight-up led by God the Father himself, no cap.
[Mormon 5:18] But now? They're getting played by Satan, getting tossed like chaff in the wind or a ship lost at sea with no sail, anchor, or rudder...just drifting, no control, same energy.
[Mormon 5:19] Peep this: the Lord's holding back their blessings...blessings they could've scored if they stayed faithful...and saving them for the Gentiles who'll end up owning the land.
[Mormon 5:20] But for real, they'll get pushed and scattered by the Gentiles; then, once that mess goes down, the Lord will remember His promise to Abraham and all Israel, say less.
[Mormon 5:21] Plus, the Lord's gonna remember all the prayers the righteous have been sending up for them, no cap.
[Mormon 5:22] Yo Gentiles, how you gonna flex against God's power if you don't repent and quit your shady moves? Bet, that's the real talk.
[Mormon 5:23] Don't you get that you're straight up in God's hands? He's got all the power, and with one big command, He can roll the earth up like a scroll...no cap.
[Mormon 5:24] So, repent and humble up before Him, or He'll drop justice on you hard...then a remnant from Jacob'll roll through like a savage lion, tearing you up with no rescue squad.
[Mormon 6:1] Aight, dropping the final chapter on my people, the Nephites; so, we marched out front, facing the Lamanites ready to throw down.
[Mormon 6:2] So, I, Mormon, slid into the Lamanite king's DMs with a letter, asking for the green light to squad up our people at the land and hill called Cumorah, where we could throw down hard.
[Mormon 6:3] And low-key, the Lamanite king said yes to my request, gave me the go-ahead for what I wanted.
[Mormon 6:4] So we rolled out to Cumorah, set up camp around the hill...it's basically surrounded by mad rivers and springs...and low-key, we hoped to get the upper hand on the Lamanites there.
[Mormon 6:5] After 384 years, we pulled the whole squad of our people together at the land of Cumorah, no cap.
[Mormon 6:6] So, once we got everyone at Cumorah, I, Mormon, started feeling my age, knowing this was the final boss fight for my people; God told me not to let the sacred records from our ancestors fall to the Lamanites 'cause they'd trash them...so I compiled this record from Nephi's plates and stashed all the other records in the hill Cumorah, leaving just a few plates to hand off to my son Moroni.
[Mormon 6:7] Now my people, with their fam and kids, spotted the Lamanite armies rolling up, and low-key, filled with that deadly fear that hits all the wicked, they just braced themselves to get clapped.
[Mormon 6:8] Then they charged at us, and every single person was shook, straight terror mode, 'cause their squad was massive AF.
[Mormon 6:9] They went full savage on my people with swords, bows, arrows, axes, and every war tool in the kit.
[Mormon 6:10] My squad got wrecked...10,000 deep with me...and I took a hit too, lying there bleeding, but the enemy just walked past without finishing me off.
[Mormon 6:11] After they slaughtered everyone but 24 of us...including my son Moroni...we, the last survivors, looked from the hill Cumorah the next day and saw the 10,000 of my fallen peeps, with me leading them front and center.
[Mormon 6:12] And we also peeped the 10,000 of my people getting led by my own son Moroni.
[Mormon 6:13] Turns out, the 10,000 of Gidgiddonah got straight up clapped, and he went down right in the middle of it.
[Mormon 6:14] Lamah, Gilgal, Limhah, Jeneum, Cumenihah, Moronihah, Antionum, Shiblom, Shem, and Josh all got taken down with their squads of 10,000 each...no survivors, straight L's all around.
[Mormon 6:15] And then ten more squads of 10,000 each got smoked by the sword; basically everyone except the 24 crew with me, plus some who dipped south or went over to the Lamanites, got wrecked... their bodies left to rot and turn back to dust, no cap.
[Mormon 6:16] My soul legit tore up with pain over my people getting wiped out, and I straight up cried out.
[Mormon 6:17] Yo, all you once shining ones, how'd y'all ghost the Lord's path? For real, how'd you say no to Jesus, who was literally waiting with open arms?
[Mormon 6:18] Low-key, if y'all hadn't dipped from the right path, you wouldn't be down like this. But here we are, and I'm straight-up grieving your loss.
[Mormon 6:19] Yo, my lit sons and daughters, moms and dads, husbands and wifeys, how tf did y'all end up taking that L?
[Mormon 6:20] But fr fr, y'all are gone for good, and no amount of my pain is gonna bring you back.
[Mormon 6:21] Real talk, the day's coming when your mortal selves put on immortality, these rotting bodies turn incorruptible, and then you gotta face Christ's judgment seat, getting judged by your deeds; if you're righteous, you flex with your OG ancestors in the afterlife.
[Mormon 6:22] Man, if only y'all had bounced back before this disaster hit. But nope, you're gone now, and the Eternal Father upstairs knows your sitch and handles you with both justice and mercy.
[Mormon 7:1] Alright, listen up remnant crew still standing...I'm dropping these words so God might vibe with y'all and you get the tea on your ancestors; yeah, I'm talking to you, leftover house of Israel...here's the plug.
[Mormon 7:2] Heads up...you're straight-up repping the house of Israel, no cap.
[Mormon 7:3] Real talk: you gotta hit that repentance grind, or salvation's a no-go.
[Mormon 7:4] Listen, drop the weapons and quit vibing with violence; don't pick them back up unless God says so, say less.
[Mormon 7:5] Bet, you gotta peep your ancestors' story, bounce back from all your sins, and stan Jesus Christ...the Son of God who got clapped by the Jews but got that epic resurrection flex from the Father, crushing death's vibe and swallowing its sting.
[Mormon 7:6] Jesus is the plug who pulls off the resurrection, raising everyone to flex before the judgment-seat.
[Mormon 7:7] Jesus locked down the world's redemption, so if you show up guilt-free on judgment day, you get the VIP pass to chill forever with God's squad singing endless hype tunes to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost...one squad, endless happiness, no cap.
[Mormon 7:8] So, bounce back and get baptized rep Jesus' name, and grab tight to Christ's gospel...that vibe's dropping not just here but also in the records bouncing from Jews to Gentiles and then back to you.
[Mormon 7:9] Look, this is penned so you catch the belief vibe; if you're in on that, you'll trust this too, and then you'll peep your ancestors and the wild things God pulled off for them.
[Mormon 7:10] You'll also vibe that you're the remnant crew from Jacob's seed, rolling with the OG covenant squad; so if you believe in Christ and get baptized...first water, then fire and Holy Ghost...just like the Savior flexed, you're set for judgment day. Amen.
[Mormon 8:1] Yo, it's Moroni wrapping up my dad Mormon's record...got just a few lines left 'cause dad said so, say less.
[Mormon 8:2] So after that savage battle at Cumorah, the Nephites who dipped south got chased down by the Lamanites till they got wiped out, no cap.
[Mormon 8:3] My dad got clapped by them too, so now it's just me left to spill the sad tea on my people's wipeout; they're ghosted, and I'm just out here obeying pops, no clue if they'll end me next.
[Mormon 8:4] So I'ma write this all down and tuck the records in the dirt; where I bounce? Doesn't even matter.
[Mormon 8:5] Check it, my dad made this record and dropped its purpose, and I'd write more if the plates had space, but nah...I'm solo, no ore, no squad, no spot to crash; dad got killed in battle, fam's gone, and I got no clue how long the Lord's letting me chill.
[Mormon 8:6] Yo, it's wild...400 years done since our Lord and Savior showed up.
[Mormon 8:7] Fr, the Lamanites hunted my Nephite crew city to city, place to place, till they ghosted for good; their fall was massive, and the destruction? Straight up mind-blowing.
[Mormon 8:8] No cap, it's all on the Lord's hand; meanwhile, the Lamanites are beefing with each other, turning the whole land into nonstop chaos and bloodshed, and no one's got the receipts on how this war ends.
[Mormon 8:9] Look, no more tea on them...it's just Lamanites and straight-up robbers left roaming this land.
[Mormon 8:10] Real talk, only Jesus' disciples know the true God...they stuck around till the people's wickedness hit peak sus, and then the Lord said "nah" to them staying; if they're still out here, no one knows.
[Mormon 8:11] But yo, my dad and I have actually seen those disciples, and they came through to help us out.
[Mormon 8:12] Whoever vibes with this record without throwing shade over its flaws will catch bigger truths than these; heads up, I'm Moroni, and if I could, I'd spill all the tea to you.
[Mormon 8:13] Yo, I'm wrapping up my rant about these people...I'm Mormon's kid, and pops traces back to Nephi, no cap.
[Mormon 8:14] I'm the one who stashed this record for the Lord; the plates themselves ain't worth much 'cause the Lord said no making bank off them, but the record? Major W. Anyone who flexes it gets mad blessings from God.
[Mormon 8:15] No one can reveal this record unless God hands them the power, 'cause God wants it done with pure vibes...eye on His glory and looking out for His OG, scattered crew.
[Mormon 8:16] Big ups to the one who brings this to light; it'll rise from the shadows to glow bright like God said, pulled from the earth, shining through the dark, hitting people's knowledge...all powered by God's flex.
[Mormon 8:17] If there's any flaws, they're just human slips; we don't see faults, but God's got all the receipts...so anyone throwing shade better watch out, or hellfire's coming for them.
[Mormon 8:18] Anyone demanding "show me or get smacked" better chill, 'cause they might be ordering stuff straight-up banned by the Lord.
[Mormon 8:19] Heads up: folks who judge on the quick are getting judged just as fast; payback's real...smack someone, and the Lord's gonna smack you back.
[Mormon 8:20] Listen up, scripture drops the rule: humans ain't for smacking or judging; judgment and clapbacks are God's flex, He promises to settle the score.
[Mormon 8:21] Anyone who spits hate and drama against God's work and His crew...the house of Israel...and says they'll wreck God's plan like He forgot His promise? That dude's asking to get chopped down and tossed in the fire.
[Mormon 8:22] God's eternal plans are unstoppable...they gon' keep moving till every single promise is locked in, no cap.
[Mormon 8:23] Peep Isaiah's prophecies...no cap, I can't even write them all. The OG saints who owned this land will scream from the dust to the Lord, and God, living for real, won't forget His promise to them.
[Mormon 8:24] God knows their prayers were all for their fam, and He sees their mad faith...mountains moved, earth shook, prisons fell, and not even fire, wild beasts, or venomous snakes could touch them, all 'cause of His word's power.
[Mormon 8:25] And check it, their prayers also had the Lord's dude in mind...the one He let go through the struggle to bring this all to light.
[Mormon 8:26] Don't let anyone flex saying these won't drop...they for sure will, 'cause God said so; they'll pop outta the earth by His hand, unstoppable, showing up when folks claim miracles are dead, like hearing someone talk from beyond the grave.
[Mormon 8:27] This'll hit when the saints' blood is screaming to God, all because of sketchy secret plots and shady dark vibes going down.
[Mormon 8:28] For real, the day's coming when God's power gets ghosted, churches get mad sus and flex with major pride; even church leaders and teachers will be all puffed up, making their own crews low-key jealous.
[Mormon 8:29] Bet, the day's coming when wildfires, storms, and smoke clouds start trending in lands far away.
[Mormon 8:30] And for real, news will blow up with wars, low-key war gossip, and earthquakes popping off all over the map.
[Mormon 8:31] Deadass, the day's coming when earth gets mad polluted, murders, thefts, lies, scams, cheating, and all kinds of nasty stuff blow up; plenty will say "Do whatever, God's got you," but no cap, that's hella sus...those peeps are trapped in bitterness and crime chains, straight up doomed.
[Mormon 8:32] Real talk, a time's gonna show up when churches pop off pushing "Pay up and get your sins wiped," straight up hustling forgiveness for cash.
[Mormon 8:33] Yo, wicked, stubborn crew...why y'all flexing fake churches just to cash in? Why you twisting God's pure word, dragging your own souls straight to hell? Peep God's revelations; the clock's ticking, and these things gotta pop off for real.
[Mormon 8:34] Check it, the Lord just dropped some insane visions on me about wild stuff about to go down when all this hits y'all.
[Mormon 8:35] Look, I'm talking like you're right here, even though you're not; but Jesus Christ flexed you in front of me, and I know exactly what's up with your moves.
[Mormon 8:36] I know y'all are strutting in mad pride; only a few aren't flexing with designer drip, envy, beef, hate, and drama; every church is straight-up dirty 'cause pride's taken over big time.
[Mormon 8:37] Real talk, y'all care more about cash, your swag, and pimped-out churches than showing love to the poor, sick, and hurting.
[Mormon 8:38] Yo, you dirty hypocrites and fake teachers selling out for trash that rots, why you messing up God's holy church? Why you too scared to rep Christ's name? Don't you get that eternal joy beats endless misery just to impress the clout-chasers?
[Mormon 8:39] Why you're flexing on dead stuff while letting the hungry, needy, naked, sick, and suffering walk past like they're invisible?
[Mormon 8:40] For real, why y'all stacking secret shady biz to make bank, making widows and orphans weep before God, while the blood of their dads and husbands screams for revenge on you from the dirt?
[Mormon 8:41] Heads up, the sword of vengeance is dangling over you, and the clock's ticking...God's gonna settle the score for the saints' blood 'cause He's done ignoring their cries.
[Mormon 9:1] Alright, now I'm talking about the folks who're out here doubting Christ.
[Mormon 9:2] Bet you'll believe when the Lord shows up...like that epic day when earth gets rolled up like a scroll and everything melts down, standing face-to-face with the Lamb of God...then you'll still say no God? Sus.
[Mormon 9:3] So, will you still deny Christ when you see the Lamb of God? You think you can chill with Him while guilt's wrecking your soul for breaking His laws? Nah, no happy vibes there.
[Mormon 9:4] Real talk, living with a holy God while knowing how filthy you are would wreck you worse than hanging with the damned in hell.
[Mormon 9:5] When you finally face your raw self before God, plus His glory and Jesus' holiness, it'll spark a fire in you that no chill can put out.
[Mormon 9:6] Yo unbelievers, turn back to the Lord and scream out to the Father in Jesus' name, so maybe you'll roll up spotless and fresh, cleansed by the Lamb's blood when the final day hits.
[Mormon 9:7] Yo, I'm calling out y'all who say God's revelations are canceled...that prophecies, gifts, healings, tongues, and their meanings are all cap and dead.
[Mormon 9:8] Look, if you deny this stuff, you low-key don't get Christ's gospel; either you ain't read the scriptures or you just totally misunderstood them.
[Mormon 9:9] Don't we all know God's the same vibes yesterday, today, and forever...no switch-ups, no shady shadow moves?
[Mormon 9:10] So if you cooked up a god who flips and switches, with shadows of change, you basically made up a god who's no miracle worker.
[Mormon 9:11] Bet, I'm about to flex the real God of miracles...the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob...same OG who crafted the whole sky, earth, and everything in between.
[Mormon 9:12] Peep this: He made Adam, and through Adam, man took the L with the fall; but because of that fall came Jesus Christ...the Father and the Son...and through Jesus came man's ultimate glow-up: redemption.
[Mormon 9:13] So because Jesus' redemption popped off, we get to roll back into God's presence; everyone's redeemed since Christ's death powers the resurrection, yanking us from eternal sleep...when the trumpet blows, all, big or small, rise up, standing free from death's temporary chains.
[Mormon 9:14] Then the Holy One drops judgment; the dirty stay dirty, the righteous stay righteous, the happy stay happy, and the unhappy stay stuck...no cap.
[Mormon 9:15] Now, to all y'all picturing a god who can't pull miracles...has everything I said already happened? Is the end here? Nah, fam, God's still running that miracle flex nonstop.
[Mormon 9:16] For real, the stuff God's done is straight-up mind-blowing to us; who can even wrap their head around God's epic moves?
[Mormon 9:17] Who's gonna say it ain't a miracle that just by His word the whole sky and earth popped into existence, man got made from dust, and mad miracles keep happening by that same word?
[Mormon 9:18] Who dares say Jesus Christ didn't pull off major miracles? Plus, His apostles were out here flexing plenty of powerful miracles too.
[Mormon 9:19] If miracles went down back then, why would God stop being a miracle-worker and still be unchangeable? Nah, He doesn't flip like that; changing means not God no more, and He's still the OG God of miracles, no cap.
[Mormon 9:20] God stops flexing miracles on us 'cause people ghost on faith, veer off the right path, and low-key don't even know which God to vibe with.
[Mormon 9:21] Listen up: anyone who straight-up believes in Christ, no cap, and doesn't doubt, when they ask the Father in Christ's name, they get the hookup; this promise is worldwide, no exceptions.
[Mormon 9:22] Jesus Christ, the Son of God, told His crew waiting around...and everyone listening...straight up: Roll out worldwide and drop the gospel to every single soul.
[Mormon 9:23] Whoever believes and gets baptized secures the W of salvation; those who don't believe? They're straight-up doomed, no cap.
[Mormon 9:24] Signs gonna ride with believers...using my name, they'll ghost demons, spit fresh tongues, handle snakes like it's nothing, sip poison with zero damage, and lay hands on the sick to heal 'em.
[Mormon 9:25] Anyone who rides or dies believing in my name, zero doubts, I'll lock down all my words for them, no matter where they at...worldwide flex.
[Mormon 9:26] Real talk, who can clap back at the Lord's works? Who can side-eye His words or throw shade at His almighty power? Who disses what He's done or hates on Christ's crew? Heads up, haters...you're gonna get blindsided and wiped out.
[Mormon 9:27] So don't diss or be shook...listen up to the Lord's words and hit up the Father in Jesus' name for whatever you need. No doubts, just believe, start like back in the day, come to the Lord full send, and grind out your salvation with respect and realness.
[Mormon 9:28] Play it smart during your trial days; ditch all the sketchy vibes; don't just ask to feed your cravings, but ask with solid faith that you'll dodge temptation and serve the real, living God...no cap.
[Mormon 9:29] Make sure you're not getting baptized unworthy or taking Christ's sacrament recklessly; do everything worthy and in Jesus Christ's name, the Son of the living God; stick with it 'til the end, and you'll never get ghosted.
[Mormon 9:30] Look, I'm talking like I'm coming straight from the dead 'cause I know y'all gonna catch and keep my words, no cap.
[Mormon 9:31] Don't roast me or my dad or the OG writers for our flaws; instead, thank God for showing you our screw-ups so you can flex more wisdom than we ever did.
[Mormon 9:32] So yeah, we dropped this record based on what we know, in the script called reformed Egyptian...handed down and tweaked by us to match how we talk.
[Mormon 9:33] If our plates were big enough, we'd have written in Hebrew, but we tweaked that too; if we went full Hebrew, your copy would be straight-up flawless, no cap.
[Mormon 9:34] But God's got the receipts on what we wrote, and since no one else knows our language, He set up the hookup to translate it, no sweat.
[Mormon 9:35] We wrote this to clear the stain of our brothers who dipped out on faith...no cap, gotta keep our names clean.
[Mormon 9:36] Check it, our hope for our brothers' comeback to knowing Christ matches the prayers of all the OG saints who've lived here.
[Mormon 9:37] Bet the Lord Jesus hooks up their prayers based on their faith; may God the Father not forget His deal with Israel and bless them forever through faith in Jesus' name. Amen.
[Ether 1:1] Yo, it's Moroni here, dropping the lowdown on the old-school folks wiped out by God's hand in this north country.
[Ether 1:2] I'm pulling my report from the 24 plates the Limhi crew found, known as the Book of Ether, say less.
[Ether 1:3] I'm guessing the first part of this record...covering world creation, Adam, and everything up to the big tower drama...is chillin' with the Jews.
[Ether 1:4] So I'm not writing stuff from Adam's day to then; it's all on the plates, and whoever finds them gets the full tea, no cap.
[Ether 1:5] Heads up, I'm not spilling the whole story, just the part from the tower drama down to when they got wiped out.
[Ether 1:6] Here's the vibe: the dude who wrote this record was Ether, a straight-up descendant of Coriantor.
[Ether 1:7] Coriantor was Moron's kid, no cap.
[Ether 1:8] Moron came straight outta Ethem, fam.
[Ether 1:9] Ethem was Ahah's kid, facts.
[Ether 1:10] Ahah was straight up Seth's son, no cap.
[Ether 1:11] Seth rolled out as Shiblon's kid, bet.
[Ether 1:12] Shiblon came thru as Com's son, say less.
[Ether 1:13] Com was born from Coriantum, no cap.
[Ether 1:14] Coriantum was straight-up Amnigaddah's kid, facts.
[Ether 1:15] Amnigaddah came through as Aaron's son, no cap.
[Ether 1:16] Aaron was repping Heth's line, and Heth was Hearthom's kid, bet.
[Ether 1:17] Hearthom was straight-up Lib's son, no cap.
[Ether 1:18] Lib came thru as Kish's kid, facts.
[Ether 1:19] Kish was repping Corom's fam as his son, say less.
[Ether 1:20] Corom rolled out as Levi's kid, no cap.
[Ether 1:21] Levi was Kim's straight-up kid, bet.
[Ether 1:22] Kim was born flexing as Morianton's son, no cap.
[Ether 1:23] Morianton was repping the lineage of Riplakish, no cap.
[Ether 1:24] Riplakish came through as Shez's kid, facts no cap.
[Ether 1:25] Shez was straight-up Heth's son, no cap.
[Ether 1:26] Heth was Com's kid, no cap.
[Ether 1:27] Com rolled up as Coriantum's son, facts.
[Ether 1:28] Coriantum was Emer's straight-up child, no cap.
[Ether 1:29] Emer was Omer's kid, no cap.
[Ether 1:30] Omer came thru as Shule's son, facts.
[Ether 1:31] Shule was Kib's straight-up kid, no cap.
[Ether 1:32] Kib came from Orihah, who was Jared's son...lineage staying solid, no cap.
[Ether 1:33] Jared and his bro pulled up with their squads from that huge tower just when God confused everyone's language, low-key mad, and swore they'd be spread all over the globe...and no cap, that's exactly how it went down.
[Ether 1:34] The brother of Jared was a whole unit, mad strong and God's fave, so Jared told him, "Hit up the Lord, pray He don't mess our language so we can still get each other."
[Ether 1:35] So the brother of Jared slid into God's DMs, and God showed mad compassion, no capping...didn't mess with Jared's language, so Jared and his bro stayed on the same wavelength.
[Ether 1:36] Then Jared told his bro, "Pray again...maybe God'll chill and not mess up the language of our homies."
[Ether 1:37] The brother of Jared went back to God, and God had mad compassion on their crew too...so their language stayed unconfused, no cap.
[Ether 1:38] Jared told his bro, "Check with God if He's gonna boot us from this spot, and if yes, ask where we should dip to. Who knows, maybe God's got us a prime spot on the map...so let's keep it real with Him to snag that inheritance."
[Ether 1:39] Following Jared's orders, the brother of Jared hit up God with prayers like he said.
[Ether 1:40] God heard the brother of Jared, showed mad compassion, and was like:
[Ether 1:41] God said, "Yo, round up your whole crew ... male and female animals, all the seeds of the earth, your fam, Jared and his fam, plus all your friends and their clans, no cap."
[Ether 1:42] Once you squad's packed, lead the way north into the valley; I'll meet you there and flex a prime spot that's the top-tier land on Earth, no cap.
[Ether 1:43] I'll bless you and your fam, build a huge squad from your line and your brother's, and those with you ... a nation flexing harder than any on Earth, all 'cause you've been grinding on me with your prayers for ages.
[Ether 2:1] Jared, his bro, their whole squads, plus their friends and crews, all dipped down north into the valley Nimrod...named after that legendary hunter...with every type of male and female flock they rounded up.
[Ether 2:2] They set up traps to snag birds and built a vessel to haul fish from the waters...say less, they came prepared.
[Ether 2:3] They even packed deseret...aka honey bees...and swarms of 'em, plus every kinda seed from the land… no cap, they came loaded.
[Ether 2:4] When they hit the valley of Nimrod, God slid down and chatted with the brother of Jared, low-key hidden in a cloud so Jared couldn't see Him.
[Ether 2:5] God told them to bounce deep into uncharted wilderness...like no human had vibed there before...and He went ahead, talking from His cloud HQ, dropping travel directions.
[Ether 2:6] They trekked through the wild, built barges, and crossed mad waters, all while God's hand was guiding their moves nonstop.
[Ether 2:7] God wasn't about them chilling mid-sea in the wild; He straight-up insisted they move on to the promised land...top-tier territory saved for the real righteous squad.
[Ether 2:8] God swore mad in His wrath to the brother of Jared: anyone holding this promised land has gotta serve Him...the one true God...or get wiped out when His full rage drops, no cap.
[Ether 2:9] So, God's rules for this promised land are clear: whoever owns it must serve Him or get obliterated when His full wrath hits... and that wrath drops once they're maxed out in sin, no cap.
[Ether 2:10] This land's the ultimate flex, best of all lands, so whoever owns it has gotta serve God or get wiped...God's eternal rule. But the wipeout only drops when the people hit peak wickedness.
[Ether 2:11] Yo Gentiles, listen up: God's rules are here so you can repent and not keep flexing sin until the full wrath drops like it did on the land's past peeps.
[Ether 2:12] This land's prime real estate, and whoever owns it gets freedom from chains and all the haters...if they serve the land's God, Jesus Christ, who's already proven Himself in these records.
[Ether 2:13] So I keep the record: God led Jared and his crew to this massive sea splitting the lands, they set up camp called Moriancumer, and vibed in tents by the shore for four years straight.
[Ether 2:14] After four years, God showed up again to the brother of Jared, standing in a cloud and chatting for three hours straight...calling him out for forgetting to hit Him up by name, no cap.
[Ether 2:15] The brother of Jared owned up to his mess and called on God's name for his crew; God said He'd forgive but warned no more sinning...His Spirit won't always be down to chill, and if y'all max out on sin, you get cut off. Also, this land He's giving is top-tier inheritance, no cap.
[Ether 2:16] God told them to get busy building barges just like before, so the brother of Jared and his squad went hard, following God's playbook. The boats ended up small and hella light, gliding on water like birds flexing their smooth moves.
[Ether 2:17] These barges were built crazy tight...like they'd hold water like a dish: bottom, sides, top, and door all sealed up perfect, with peaked ends and length as long as a tree. No leaks, no cap.
[Ether 2:18] Then the brother of Jared hit up the Lord, saying, "Yo, I did the work you told me...barges built exactly how you said."
[Ether 2:19] He told God, "Yo, there's zero light in these barges...how we supposed to navigate? Plus, we can't even breathe in there except the air inside, so we're basically toast."
[Ether 2:20] God told the brother of Jared, "Make a hole up top and one at the bottom; when you're gasping for air, open the hole to breathe. If water starts flooding in, just seal it tight so you don't drown."
[Ether 2:21] Straight up, the brother of Jared followed God's orders and did exactly as He said.
[Ether 2:22] He hit up God again like, "Lord, I did what you said, built the boats for my crew, but there's zero light inside...are you really gonna let us cross this huge ocean in total darkness?"
[Ether 2:23] God replied, "What you want me to do so your boats got light? Windows ain't a flex...they'd just get smashed, and no fire for light either, that's a no-go for the trip."
[Ether 2:24] You'll be like a whale battling monster waves in the ocean, but don't sweat it...I got you. I'll lift you up from the deep 'cause I sent the winds, rains, and floods myself, no cap.
[Ether 2:25] Look, I'm prepping you for all this wild stuff...waves, winds, floods...'cause you can't cross the deep without my backup. So, what you want me to hook you up with for light when you're deep underwater?
[Ether 3:1] So the brother of Jared...he had eight boats ready...climbed up the huge Mount Shelem and straight-up melted sixteen clear, glass-like stones outta rock, then held them up top and called out to God again.
[Ether 3:2] He was like, "Lord, you said we gotta deal with these floods. Don't be mad at me for being weak...I know you're holy and we're kinda sus 'cause of the fall messing up our vibes. Still, you said we should call on you to get what we need, so here I am."
[Ether 3:3] He said, "Lord, you smacked us down for our sins and kicked us out, been wandering mad years, but you still showed mercy. So please, have some pity, chill on the anger, and don't let us cross this savage ocean in pitch dark...check these stones I melted from rock."
[Ether 3:4] Straight up, I know you got all the clout, Lord, and can do anything for us humans; so just tap those stones with your finger and make 'em glow in the dark so we can have light cruising through the sea in our boats.
[Ether 3:5] Yo Lord, you can totally pull this off. We know you flex power that blows minds, even if humans don't get how massive it really is.
[Ether 3:6] Right after the brother of Jared said that, God reached out and touched each stone with his finger; then the brother's eyes got the full unfiltered upgrade and he saw God's finger looking just like a regular human finger...flesh and blood...and he legit freaked and dropped to his knees.
[Ether 3:7] God peeped that the brother of Jared was faceplanting and was like, "Get up, why you down like that?"
[Ether 3:8] He told God, "I saw your finger and low-key freaked, thinking you'd smite me; didn't know you had actual flesh and blood vibes."
[Ether 3:9] God said, "Your faith's been next-level, that's why you saw me rocking flesh and blood; no one's ever rolled up with that much faith. If not, you wouldn't have peeped my finger. Did you catch more than that?"
[Ether 3:10] He hit back, "Nah, Lord, show me the full vibe...let me see you for real."
[Ether 3:11] God was like, "You really trust the words I'm about to drop?"
[Ether 3:12] He said, "Bet, Lord, I know you keep it 100...you're the God of truth and can't front."
[Ether 3:13] Right after that, God flexed his full self to him and said, "Since you get all this, you're redeemed from the fall and back in my presence...so yeah, I'm showing up for you."
[Ether 3:14] Yo, I'm the OG plan since day one, here to save my people. I'm Jesus Christ...the Father and the Son. Through me, everyone who vibes with my name gets eternal life and becomes my fam, sons and daughters for real.
[Ether 3:15] I've never shown up like this to anyone I made, 'cause no one's believed in me like you do. You see you're made in my image? Yeah, everyone was crafted from the jump with my vibe stamped on 'em.
[Ether 3:16] Peep this body you see? That's the body of my spirit; I made humans in the same mold. Just like you see me in spirit form, I'll show up to my people in straight-up flesh and blood.
[Ether 3:17] So yeah, like I said, I can't spill all the tea on this, but Jesus showed up to this guy in spirit form, looking just like the body he flexed to the Nephites...say less.
[Ether 3:18] He served him up just like he did with the Nephites, all so this dude could know for sure he's God...no cap...based on all the crazy miracles the Lord had already shown him.
[Ether 3:19] Because this guy had mad knowledge, he couldn't resist peeping behind the veil; when he saw Jesus' finger, he froze up, knowing it was straight-up the Lord's. His faith? Gone...he was sure, no cap, zero doubts.
[Ether 3:20] So with perfect God knowledge, he couldn't stay hidden behind the veil; he saw Jesus and straight-up served him.
[Ether 3:21] Then God told the brother of Jared, "Hold up...don't spill what you've seen and heard until I flex my name in the flesh. So stash all that info tight, no leaks, no cap."
[Ether 3:22] When you roll up to me, you'll write this stuff down and lock it up tight in a language no one can decode...total uncrackable vibes.
[Ether 3:23] Peep this, I'm handing you two stones, and you'll seal them up with all the stuff you're gonna write down...no cap, keep it locked.
[Ether 3:24] Look, I scrambled the language you'll write in, but in my own time, these stones will legit magnify what you wrote so people can peep it with their own eyes.
[Ether 3:25] After dropping those words, the Lord showed the brother of Jared every single person who ever lived and who would live, no cap, no secrets...straight up full panorama till the world's end.
[Ether 3:26] God had told him before, "If you believe in me, I'll show you everything," so no way the Lord was holding back because He knew He could flex all the receipts.
[Ether 3:27] Then the Lord said, "Put all this down and lock it tight; when the time's right, I'll reveal it to humanity...say less."
[Ether 3:28] So the Lord told him to seal up those two stones tight and keep them on the DL until God decides it's time to flex them to the world.
[Ether 4:1] The Lord told the brother of Jared to dip from the mountain, write down everything he'd seen, but keep it on lockdown...no one gets these receipts till after Christ gets lifted on the cross. King Mosiah played gatekeeper to keep it ghost till Jesus showed up to His squad.
[Ether 4:2] After Jesus made His grand entrance to His crew, He gave the green light to drop those hidden truths for all to see.
[Ether 4:3] But yeah, after that, most peeps ghosted on faith, except the Lamanites who straight-up said nah to Christ's gospel, so I got the order to stash these things back underground.
[Ether 4:4] Look, I put down on these plates exactly what the brother of Jared saw...no cap, nothing cooler has ever been revealed than what he witnessed.
[Ether 4:5] So God told me to write it all down, and I did; then He said seal that up, including the key to decode it...so I locked down the interpreters just like the Lord ordered.
[Ether 4:6] The Lord told me: these won't drop to the Gentiles until they clean up their act and get right with Him...no cap.
[Ether 4:7] The Lord says when they flex faith in Him like the brother of Jared did and get sanctified in Him, He'll reveal all the secrets the brother of Jared saw...full-on unveiling of His revelations, signed Jesus Christ, Son of God, OG of heaven, earth, and everything in between.
[Ether 4:8] Anyone trying to throw shade on God's word or deny this? Big yikes...they're getting cursed, no cap; Jesus Christ here says He won't reveal more to those haters, 'cause I'm the OG speaker.
[Ether 4:9] When I say jump, the heavens open or close; my word makes the earth shake; and at my command, its people vanish like smoke in fire...facts.
[Ether 4:10] If you don't vibe with my words, you're disrespecting my squad too; and if I ever stay silent, y'all judge for yourselves...one day you'll peep it's me talking, no cap, on the last day.
[Ether 4:11] But if you're down with what I'm saying, I'll hit you up with my Spirit's vibes, and you'll know and testify straight up...my Spirit's the real plug that convinces folks to flex good moves.
[Ether 4:12] Anything that convinces people to do good? That's all me...good vibes don't come from anyone else. I'm the one guiding everyone to the real W's. If you don't trust my words, you're basically ghosting on me...and if you ghost on me, you're ghosting on the Father who sent me. FYI, I'm the Father, the light, the life, and the ultimate truth of this world...say less.
[Ether 4:13] Yo Gentiles, roll up to me and I'll flex the bigger secrets, the hidden knowledge locked down 'cause y'all been low-key unbelieving.
[Ether 4:14] House of Israel, come thru and I'll show you the epic blessings the Father's been stashin' for you since day one, but y'all missed out 'cause of that unbelief energy.
[Ether 4:15] Listen up...once y'all tear off that unbelief veil that's keeping you stuck in trash vibes, cold hearts, and brain fog, the insane blessings hidden since the OG days will drop on you. For real, when you hit up the Father in my name, broken heart and all, you'll see He's still got your back with the promises made to your ancestors, house of Israel.
[Ether 4:16] Then my revelations, penned by my homie John, will be unboxed for everyone to see. Keep this on your radar...when you peep these signs, know the time's legit to drop and go full manifest.
[Ether 4:17] So when you get this record, flex this: the Father's work has officially kicked off all over the land.
[Ether 4:18] Yo, everyone everywhere...repent, slide to me, trust my gospel, and get baptized in my name; if you believe and get dunked, you're saved, but if not, you're toast; plus, believers get all the receipts with signs flexing after them.
[Ether 4:19] Big ups to anyone who stays loyal to my name till the last day...they'll get boosted to chill in the kingdom set up for them since day one. And bruh, I'm the one who said it. Amen.
[Ether 5:1] Yo, it's me Moroni, I dropped these words like I was told, straight from memory; I also told you what I locked away...so don't touch that stuff to translate unless God says it's the move, no cap.
[Ether 5:2] Hey, consider yourself lucky...you get to flex the plates to the squad helping drop this whole work.
[Ether 5:3] God's power gonna show the plates to three people, so they'll know 100% this stuff's legit, no cap.
[Ether 5:4] Facts get sealed by three witnesses spitting truth; their testimony, plus this work flexing God's power and word...confirmed by Father, Son, and Holy Ghost...will roast the world as a final tea at judgment day.
[Ether 5:5] If they switch up, hit up the Father in Jesus' name, they're straight-up accepted into God's kingdom, no cap.
[Ether 5:6] If you think I ain't got the authority, y'all judge for yourselves; you'll know I do when we both stand before God on the last day. Amen.
[Ether 6:1] Aight, it's Moroni back at it, dropping the record on Jared and his bro.
[Ether 6:2] So after the Lord hooked up the stones Jared's bro hauled up the mountain, he came down, popped the stones into the ships...one on each end...and boom, those stones lit up the vessels like a vibe check.
[Ether 6:3] So, the Lord made those stones glow in the dark to give light to men, women, and kids...no cap, so they wouldn't be lost crossing the big waters in the dark.
[Ether 6:4] After they packed all kinds of food for themselves and their animals, hopped on their ships, and set sail into the sea, they put their trust straight in the Lord.
[Ether 6:5] Then the Lord God sent a savage wind blowing over the water, pushing them straight toward the promised land, making the waves throw them around like crazy.
[Ether 6:6] They got dunked deep under the sea more times than they could count 'cause of those huge mountain waves and wild storms whipped up by the fierce wind.
[Ether 6:7] When they got swallowed by the deep, no water could mess them up... their ships were sealed tight like Noah's ark; so, surrounded by waves, they called out to the Lord, and He popped them back up to the surface.
[Ether 6:8] The wind kept blasting nonstop toward the promised land while they were out at sea, pushin' them forward like they had no choice.
[Ether 6:9] They sung mad praise to the Lord; Jared's bro kept thanking Him all day, and even when night dropped, the praise train didn't stop.
[Ether 6:10] They cruised on, no sea beast or whale could mess them up, and they had nonstop light whether above or below the waves.
[Ether 6:11] So yeah, they got pushed along for a full 344 days straight on the water, no cap.
[Ether 6:12] They finally touched down on the promised land's shore, dropped to the ground, humbled themselves before the Lord, and straight up cried tears of joy 'cause His mercy was mad real for them.
[Ether 6:13] They stepped out onto the land and started grinding, tilling the earth to make it theirs.
[Ether 6:14] Jared had four sons: Jacom, Gilgah, Mahah, and Orihah...name squad complete.
[Ether 6:15] The brother of Jared wasn't playin'...he had sons and daughters too, expanding the fam.
[Ether 6:16] Jared, his bro, and their crew were like 22 strong, and they all had kids before hitting the promised land...so their squad started getting mad big.
[Ether 6:17] They got schooled to keep humble vibes before the Lord and received lessons straight from the top.
[Ether 6:18] They started spreading out all over the land, multiplying and grinding the earth, leveling up strong in their new spot.
[Ether 6:19] When the brother of Jared got up there in years and peeped his time was almost up, he told Jared, "Let's squad up and count everyone so we can know what they need before we dip to the grave."
[Ether 6:20] So they rounded up the crew; the brother of Jared had 22 sons and daughters, while Jared, with his 4 sons, had 12 kids total.
[Ether 6:21] After counting their peeps, they asked what the squad wanted them to handle before they bounced to the grave.
[Ether 6:22] The people were like, "Bet, pick one of your sons to be our king," and they were all in on that move.
[Ether 6:23] But low-key, that idea hit them hard, and the brother of Jared was like, "For real, this vibes like it'll chain us up in captivity."
[Ether 6:24] Jared told his bro, "Let them have their king, no cap." Then he said, "Pick whoever you want from our sons to be king, say less."
[Ether 6:25] They picked the brother of Jared's firstborn, Pagag, but dude dipped on the king role. The people wanted his dad to make him, but nah...his dad said no forcing kings on anyone, facts.
[Ether 6:26] They slid to all Pagag's bros, but each one was like, "Nah, not the king energy for me."
[Ether 6:27] Same deal with Jared's sons...except one dude...still no king vibes; finally, Orihah got crowned king over the squad.
[Ether 6:28] Orihah started his reign, and the people started flexing mad prosperity, stacking hella riches.
[Ether 6:29] Jared checked out, and his brother dipped too, no cap.
[Ether 6:30] Orihah kept it humble with God, remembering all the epic stuff God did for his dad, and flexed those receipts to teach the people about their ancestors' blessings.
[Ether 7:1] Orihah ran justice in the land with straight-up righteousness all his days, and that era was mad long, no cap.
[Ether 7:2] He popped out 31 kids...23 sons and the rest daughters...definitely a big crew.
[Ether 7:3] Even in his twilight years, he had Kib, who took over the throne, and Kib then had Corihor.
[Ether 7:4] At 32, Corihor clapped back on his dad, bounced to Nehor's crew, had mad cute kids, and low-key pulled a cult following.
[Ether 7:5] After flexing a whole army, Corihor rolled up to Moron, snatched the king hostage...ultimate receipts on the brother of Jared's prophecy about captivity.
[Ether 7:6] Moron's land, where the king held court, was basically next-door to Desolation, as the Nephites call it.
[Ether 7:7] Kib stayed locked down with his crew under Corihor's control till he got real old, but even in captivity, he still fathered Shule late in life.
[Ether 7:8] Shule caught mad beef with his brother, leveled up strong AF, flexing both muscle and savage judgment skills.
[Ether 7:9] So Shule hit up Hill Ephraim, forged steel swords for his squad, rolled back to Nehor, clapped back on Corihor, and snatched the crown back for his dad Kib.
[Ether 7:10] Since Shule pulled that boss move, his dad handed him the kingdom like a trophy, and Shule started repping the throne.
[Ether 7:11] He ran justice straight up righteous and expanded his kingdom everywhere since the squad was hella huge by then.
[Ether 7:12] Shule also low-key stacked up a big fam with tons of sons and daughters.
[Ether 7:13] Corihor had a serious glow-up, trashing his old bad vibes, so Shule handed him some clout in the kingdom.
[Ether 7:14] Corihor went big with a squad of sons and daughters, including a dude named Noah repping in the fam.
[Ether 7:15] Noah threw major shade, flipping against King Shule and even his own dad Corihor, pulling his bro Cohor plus the whole crew into the drama.
[Ether 7:16] He beefed with King Shule, snagged their OG homeland, and flexed hard by claiming king status over that turf.
[Ether 7:17] Then he threw down with King Shule again, caught him slipping, and dragged him off captive to Moron...big L for Shule.
[Ether 7:18] Just when Noah was bout to end Shule, Shule's sons pulled a stealth move, snuck into Noah's crib at night, iced him, busted Shule outta prison, and got their dad back on the throne.
[Ether 7:19] Noah's son tried building his own kingdom, but no cap, they never flexed over King Shule again, and Shule's crew just kept leveling up and getting mad successful.
[Ether 7:20] The land got split, creating two squads: Shule's kingdom and Cohor's ... Noah's son repping his own turf.
[Ether 7:21] Cohor, Noah's son, got his crew to throw hands at Shule, but Shule clapped back hard, taking out Cohor himself...big W for Shule.
[Ether 7:22] Cohor's son Nimrod straight-up handed the kingdom back to Shule, vibed with him so hard Shule blessed him big time, letting Nimrod run things his way in the kingdom.
[Ether 7:23] While Shule was ruling, prophets showed up, straight from the Lord, spilling receipts that the people's wicked vibes and idol worship were cursing the land...repent or get wrecked, no cap.
[Ether 7:24] The people threw major shade and clowned the prophets, but King Shule wasn't having that...he dropped the hammer on anyone disrespecting the messengers.
[Ether 7:25] Shule flexed a law giving prophets full roam to roam anywhere, and low-key that move got the people to hit pause and actually repent.
[Ether 7:26] Since the people bounced back from their sins and idol worship, the Lord showed mercy, and they started thriving again; meanwhile, Shule was out here popping out kids in his twilight years.
[Ether 7:27] No more beefs popped off during Shule's reign; he kept it 100 remembering all the Lord did to get their squad across the deep waters into the promised land, so he ruled fair and square all day every day.
[Ether 8:1] So Shule had Omer, who took over the throne; Omer had Jared, and Jared came through with a whole squad of sons and daughters.
[Ether 8:2] Jared threw major shade at his dad, dipped to land of Heth, and low-key charmed half the kingdom with his slick talk and smooth rizz.
[Ether 8:3] After snatching half the kingdom, Jared went full savage on his dad, clapped him into captivity, and made him the ultimate servant in lockdown.
[Ether 8:4] During Omer's reign, dude spent half his days locked up, but still managed to have kids, including Esrom and Coriantumr...family flex, even in captivity.
[Ether 8:5] Esrom and Coriantumr were mad salty over Jared's moves, so they rallied an army and low-key ambushed him with a night attack.
[Ether 8:6] After they clapped Jared's squad, they were ready to cap him too, but Jared begged for mercy, promising to hand the throne back to his dad… they vibed and spared him.
[Ether 8:7] Jared got majorly shook and low-key depressed over losing the kingdom, 'cause he was all about that crown and clout.
[Ether 8:8] Jared's daughter, a total boss lady, saw her dad's pain and cooked up a slick plan to get the kingdom back for him.
[Ether 8:9] Jared's daughter was straight-up stunning and said to her dad, "Why you so down? Didn't you peep the records our ancestors brought over the big ocean? They slid into kingdoms and mad glory with their low-key schemes."
[Ether 8:10] So listen, let dad call Akish, Kimnor's son; I'm fine as hell, I'll dance and vibe so hard he can't resist marrying me. If he asks to have me, tell him it's a deal only if he brings my dad's king head...say less.
[Ether 8:11] Omer and Akish were tight, so when Jared hit up Akish, Jared's daughter danced her way into his heart, and Akish was like, "Bet, I want her as my wife."
[Ether 8:12] Jared hit back, "I'll hand her over if you come through with my dad the king's head, no cap."
[Ether 8:13] Akish pulled up all his squad to Jared's spot and was like, "Y'all down to swear loyalty for what I'm about to drop on ya?"
[Ether 8:14] Everyone swore on God, the sky, the earth, and their own heads that if anyone dipped from Akish's plan or spilled the tea, they'd get straight-up decapitated or worse...no cap.
[Ether 8:15] So they all locked in with Akish, who hit them with ancient oaths passed down from OG power-hunters dating back to Cain, the original murderer.
[Ether 8:16] Fueled by devil vibes, they pushed these oaths to keep folks in the dark, helping power-hungry types flex with murder, theft, lies, and all kinds of nasty sin moves.
[Ether 8:17] Jared's daughter planted the idea to dig up these ancient dark secrets, Jared passed the vibe to Akish, who then convinced his crew with sweet talk to follow his every move.
[Ether 8:18] They ended up creating a hella sus secret squad, just like the OGs, mad wicked and totally loathed by God.
[Ether 8:19] God's not about those shady secret squads or bloodshed...He's banned that from day one, no exceptions.
[Ether 8:20] I'm Moroni, and I'm not spilling the exact oaths or secret combos since I know these shady moves are everywhere...even among the Lamanites.
[Ether 8:21] These secret squads straight-up led to wiping out the people I'm talking about and also took down the Nephites too.
[Ether 8:22] Any nation that rides with these secret squads chasing power and cash till they take over? Bet...they're doomed. God won't stand for His saints' blood crying out for revenge forever without Him dropping justice.
[Ether 8:23] Yo Gentiles, God's dropping wisdom so you can peep these vibes and bounce from your sins, or else these power-hungry murder squads will clap back with destruction...no cap, God's justice sword will fall on you and wreck everything if you let it slide.
[Ether 8:24] So God commands: when you spot these shady secret squads popping up, wake the hell up about how deep you're in...otherwise, you're asking for it, 'cause the blood of the victims is screaming for revenge from the dirt on both the squad and their creators.
[Ether 8:25] Anyone building these squads is out here trying to snatch freedom from every land and nation, causing mad destruction...all 'cause the devil, king of lies and OG deceiver who tricked Adam and Eve, keeps hardening hearts so folks kill prophets, throw shade, and exile them from day one.
[Ether 8:26] So yeah, I'm Moroni, ordered to drop these truths to cancel evil, kill Satan's grip on hearts, and get folks hyped on doing good 24/7...pulling up to the ultimate source of righteousness to snag salvation.
[Ether 9:1] I'm Moroni back at it with the record...so peep this: thanks to Akish and his squad's sneaky secret combos, they straight-up toppled Omer's kingdom, no cap.
[Ether 9:2] Still, God showed mercy to Omer and his kids who weren't out here trying to take him down...big W for them.
[Ether 9:3] God hit up Omer in a dream saying, "Bounce from the land." So Omer dipped with his fam, traveled mad days past the hill of Shim and where the Nephites got wrecked, then east to Ablom by the shore, where he set up camp with everyone except Jared and his crew.
[Ether 9:4] So Jared got crowned king, but low-key through sketchy moves, and he married off his daughter to Akish.
[Ether 9:5] Akish low-key aimed to kill his father-in-law, rallied his ancient-oath squad, and they straight-up snagged his head while he was chilling on the throne, running the show.
[Ether 9:6] This nasty secret squad blew up so bad it messed with everyone's hearts; Jared got iced on his throne, and Akish took over the crown, no cap.
[Ether 9:7] Akish got mad salty over his son, locked him up with barely any food, and low-key starved him to death.
[Ether 9:8] Nimrah, the bro of the dude who died, was straight-up heated at their dad for what he did to his sibling.
[Ether 9:9] So Nimrah squad-assembled a few guys, dipped from the land, and linked up with Omer to crash.
[Ether 9:10] Akish had more sons who low-key charmed the crowd, even though they pledged to ride dirty doing all his shady bids.
[Ether 9:11] Akish's crew was hungry for cash like Akish was thirsty for power, so his sons threw money around and pulled most people into their vibe.
[Ether 9:12] Then Akish and his sons started beef that went on for years, wiping out almost everyone in the kingdom...except for like thirty peeps and those who bounced with Omer's fam.
[Ether 9:13] So Omer got his land back...straight-up reclaimed his homeland, no cap.
[Ether 9:14] Omer was aging big time, but still popped out Emer and hyped him up as the next king to take his spot.
[Ether 9:15] After crowning Emer king, Omer peeped two years of peace then dipped for good, after a lifetime packed with mad sorrow; Emer then took the throne and followed his dad's footsteps, no cap.
[Ether 9:16] The Lord started lifting the curse off the land again, and Emer's fam flexed hard...62 years in, they blew up strong and got mad rich.
[Ether 9:17] They had the whole flex...fruits, grains, silk fits, fresh linen, gold, silver, and all kinds of pricey drip.
[Ether 9:18] Plus, they owned every kinda livestock...oxen, cows, sheep, pigs, goats, and a whole zoo of other eats for the squad.
[Ether 9:19] They also had horses and donkeys, plus elephants, cureloms, and cumoms...basically the ultimate work animals, especially those big beasts.
[Ether 9:20] So the Lord stacked mad blessings on this prime land, saying whoever owns it gotta keep it for Him, or when they get too sus, they'll get wrecked...He's ready to drop full wrath on the wicked, no cap.
[Ether 9:21] Emer ran justice straight-up righteous all his life, had a bunch of kids, and hyped Coriantum as the next king to take his spot.
[Ether 9:22] After crowning Coriantum king, Emer chilled for 4 more years, saw peace everywhere, even caught a glimpse of the Son of Righteousness, flexed hard on that vibe, and then bounced in peace.
[Ether 9:23] Coriantum stepped up like his dad, built mad strong cities, and kept the good vibes flowing for his people all his life...yet, low-key, he stayed childless even into old age.
[Ether 9:24] His wife clocked out at 102, and then Coriantum, even in old age, snagged a young wife and had kids, living all the way to 142 years old...say less.
[Ether 9:25] So Coriantum had Com, who took the throne, ruled for 49 years, and had Heth plus a crew of other kids.
[Ether 9:26] The squad spread all over the land again, but wickedness blew up big time...Heth low-key started scheming old shady plots to take down his dad.
[Ether 9:27] No cap, Heth straight up offed his dad with his own sword and snatched the throne for himself.
[Ether 9:28] Prophets popped up again, shouting "repent or catch these curses"...threatening a brutal famine that'd wipe them out if they didn't fix their ways, no cap.
[Ether 9:29] But the people ghosted the prophets, threw them out...some even dumped in pits to die...all under king Heth's sus orders.
[Ether 9:30] Then the land caught a major drought, and people started dropping mad quick 'cause no rain was hitting the earth, real tough times.
[Ether 9:31] Poisonous snakes rolled up all over the land, venom-slapping mad folks; even the flocks dipped, running south to Nephites' spot, Zarahemla.
[Ether 9:32] Tons fell out on the road, but a few managed to escape and make it down south.
[Ether 9:33] Then the Lord was like, "No more chasing," and made the snakes block the path so anyone trying to cross would get snagged and bitten, big oof.
[Ether 9:34] The people followed the animals' trail, snacking on dead ones till none left; when they realized they're doomed, they started repenting and crying out to the Lord, fr fr.
[Ether 9:35] Once they humbled up enough, the Lord dripped rain on the earth; the people bounced back, fruits popped up in the north and everywhere, and God flexed big time saving them from the famine.
[Ether 10:1] So Shez, Heth's descendant (since famine snatched Heth and his fam except Shez), started repping the comeback, rebuilding the broken squad.
[Ether 10:2] Shez remembered his dads' downfall and built a righteous kingdom, keeping the Lord's move bringing Jared and bro across the deep in his brain; he stayed on God's path and had kids.
[Ether 10:3] Shez's oldest son, also named Shez, went full rebel, but got clapped by a robber chasing his fat stacks...bringing peace back to his dad, no cap.
[Ether 10:4] His dad built mad cities all over the land, and people started spreading out again; Shez lived mad long, had Riplakish, then died, passing the crown to his son.
[Ether 10:5] Riplakish ain't flex right with the Lord; he stacked up wives and concubines, then loaded crazy burdens on the people, taxing heavy just to build big fancy buildings.
[Ether 10:6] He flexed with a crazy nice throne, built lots of prisons, and threw anyone who dodged taxes or couldn't pay behind bars; made them grind nonstop to survive, and if you refused to work, death was the only option...no cap.
[Ether 10:7] So he scored all his bling and fancy crafts by forcing prison grind; meanwhile, he messed up the people bad with his wild sins and straight-up abominations.
[Ether 10:8] After ruling 42 years, the people snapped and rebelled; war broke out hard, Riplakish got capped, and his crew got yeeted from the land.
[Ether 10:9] Years later, Morianton...Riplakish's descendant...squad up with outcasts, clapped the people in battle, took over tons of cities; the war dragged on hard for years, but he snatched full power and crowned himself king of the whole land.
[Ether 10:10] Once king, he chilled the people's load, earning mad favor, so they straight-up anointed him their king...big moves, no cap.
[Ether 10:11] He kept it fair with the people but played dirty with himself through mad sins, so he got ghosted by the Lord's presence, no rizz left.
[Ether 10:12] Morianton flexed by building tons of cities, and under his reign, the people got hella rich...mad buildings, stacks of gold and silver, and booming crops and herds all restored to them.
[Ether 10:13] Morianton clocked mad years, had Kim who took over; Kim reigned eight years after his dad dipped, but he didn't run things right, so the Lord wasn't vibing with him.
[Ether 10:14] His brother threw hands, rebelled, and snatched him captive; dude stayed locked up all his life, had kids in captivity, and even had Levi in old age before he finally died.
[Ether 10:15] After his dad passed, Levi served locked up for 42 years, then went to war against the king and snatched the kingdom for himself.
[Ether 10:16] Once Levi scored the kingdom, he played right by the Lord's rules; the people thrived, he lived long, had kids, and passed the crown to Corom, whom he anointed king.
[Ether 10:17] Corom kept it 100 with the Lord his whole life, had a big fam, and after many days, he passed like everyone else; then Kish took the throne.
[Ether 10:18] Kish clocked out too, and Lib slid up to take the throne.
[Ether 10:19] Lib kept it righteous in God's eyes, wiped out the poisonous serpents, then headed south hunting since the land was packed with forest animals...and Lib himself flexed as a top hunter.
[Ether 10:20] They popped off building a massive city right at the narrow neck where the sea splits the land, major strategic flex.
[Ether 10:21] They kept the land south as wild turf for hunting, while the whole north side was packed with people, no cap.
[Ether 10:22] They were grinding hard, buying, selling, and trading nonstop to stack their paper and secure the bag.
[Ether 10:23] They flexed on all kinds of ores...gold, silver, iron, brass...you name it, digging mad earth piles to score metal and crafting hella fine gear.
[Ether 10:24] They rocked silks and fancy linen, crafting all kinds of threads to cover their naked vibes, say less.
[Ether 10:25] They cooked up every tool needed to work the land...plowing, sowing, reaping, hoeing, even thrashing...straight up farming pros.
[Ether 10:26] They crafted every kind of tool to boss their beasts around and get that work done.
[Ether 10:27] They forged all types of war weapons and flexed mad skills making crazy intricate gear, no cap.
[Ether 10:28] No squad ever got more blessed or leveled up harder than them, chilling in the best land...God literally said it's top-tier.
[Ether 10:29] Lib lived mad years, had a bunch of kids, sons and daughters, including Hearthom...say less.
[Ether 10:30] Hearthom took over after his dad and ruled 24 years, but then the kingdom got jacked from him, and he spent the rest of his days locked up...major L.
[Ether 10:31] Hearthom had Heth, who lived his whole life in captivity; Heth had Aaron, stuck captive too; Aaron had Amnigaddah, same captive vibe; Amnigaddah had Coriantum, also captive for life; and Coriantum had Com...this family's lowkey cursed with the lockdown life.
[Ether 10:32] Com snatched half the kingdom and flexed over it for 42 years, then went head-to-head with King Amgid in a long-ass war, eventually clapping Amgid and snagging the rest of the kingdom too.
[Ether 10:33] During Com's reign, robbers popped off, bringing back ancient schemes and shady oaths, all trying to flex and wreck the kingdom again.
[Ether 10:34] Com threw down hard against them, but no cap, he couldn't fully clap those robbers.
[Ether 11:1] While Com was ruling, a bunch of prophets rolled up, dropping warnings that this epic squad's doomed unless they bounce from murder and bad vibes and run back to God...say less.
[Ether 11:2] The people low-key threw shade at the prophets, so they dipped to Com for the W, 'cause the squad was tryna cancel them hard.
[Ether 11:3] The prophets hit Com with mad prophecies, and tbh, he vibed blessed for the rest of his days...big W energy.
[Ether 11:4] Com pulled an OG flex, lived long, had Shiblom who took the throne, but Shiblom's bro went rogue and sparked a massive war across the land...big sus energy.
[Ether 11:5] Shiblom's bro went full savage, having all the doom-telling prophets straight-up killed...no cap, total cancel.
[Ether 11:6] The whole land got hit with major chaos 'cause the prophets said a huge curse and epic destruction...like, record-breaking bad vibes...would drop unless the people bounced from their wicked ways, or they'd be straight-up dust.
[Ether 11:7] The squad ghosted God's warnings 'cause their sketchy plots were too sus, so wars, famines, and plagues exploded everywhere...total apocalypse mode like never before...and all this went down while Shiblom ran the show.
[Ether 11:8] The people finally caught the vibe and started owning up to their sins, and God, lowkey moved by that, showed them mercy.
[Ether 11:9] Shiblom got clapped, and Seth got snatched, stuck locked down for life...no freedom flex for him.
[Ether 11:10] Ahah, his son, snagged the throne and ran the show with mad sin, causing hella bloodshed, but his hype was short-lived...he didn't last long.
[Ether 11:11] Ethem, Ahah's offshoot, grabbed the crown too, but low-key he kept the wicked vibes rolling in his reign.
[Ether 11:12] During Ethem's reign, a bunch of prophets rolled up dropping major receipts that God would wipe them out for good unless they bounced from their wicked ways...say less.
[Ether 11:13] The people went full stubborn mode, ignoring the prophets' warnings, so the prophets dipped, straight up mourning the no-rizz crowd.
[Ether 11:14] Ethem ran bad judgment all day, every day, had a kid Moron, who took over and kept flexing wicked moves straight up defying God.
[Ether 11:15] A rebellion popped off 'cause of some sus secret squad chasing power and cash, and this savage dude showed up, clapped half the kingdom off Moron, holding that half down for years.
[Ether 11:16] Moron bounced back, clapped the rebel, and snatched the kingdom back...main character energy restored.
[Ether 11:17] Then another big-shot popped up, repping the fam of the brother of Jared...legacy vibes confirmed.
[Ether 11:18] This new boss clapped Moron and took the throne, leaving Moron locked up for life, while he had a kid named Coriantor.
[Ether 11:19] Coriantor was stuck in captivity his whole life, no cap.
[Ether 11:20] While Coriantor was locked up, tons of prophets showed up spitting big truths and calling for repentance, warning that if the people kept flexing sin, God would clap back hard and wipe them out.
[Ether 11:21] God was gonna slide in and drop a whole new crew to claim the land, doing His thing just like He did with their ancestors...no cap.
[Ether 11:22] They ghosted all the prophets' messages 'cause they were deep in that sus secret squad and running wild with wicked moves.
[Ether 11:23] Coriantor had a son named Ether and then died, stuck in captivity his whole grind.
[Ether 12:1] Ether was living during Coriantumr's reign...dude was king over the whole land, no cap.
[Ether 12:2] Ether was straight-up a Lord prophet, and in Coriantumr's days, he couldn't hold back spitting prophecy 'cause the Spirit had him lit.
[Ether 12:3] From sunrise to sunset, Ether was yelling at the crowd to believe in God and repent or get wiped out, dropping that faith unlocks all the W's.
[Ether 12:4] So if you vibe with God, you can def hope for a better world...like chilling at His right hand...and that hope, powered by faith, becomes a solid anchor for your soul, keeping you steady and grinding in good deeds, all to flex God's glory.
[Ether 12:5] Ether dropped some epic prophecies, but the people caught no rizz 'cause they couldn't see the receipts.
[Ether 12:6] Moroni here, saying faith's all about vibing with what you hope for, even if you can't see it yet...so chill on the doubt; you don't get the receipts until your faith actually gets tested.
[Ether 12:7] Christ flexed Himself to our ancestors post-resurrection only after they had faith...so no faith, no sight; real talk, He didn't just cameo for the whole world, only the faithful got the exclusive.
[Ether 12:8] Since some folks had faith, Christ flexed Himself to the world, hyped up the Father's name, and paved the way so others could snag that heavenly hookup and vibe with hope for what's still unseen.
[Ether 12:9] So yeah, you can catch that hope and join the crew of the gift...just gotta show up with faith, no cap.
[Ether 12:10] Real talk, back in the day, faith was the VIP pass to roll with God's holy squad.
[Ether 12:11] So Moses got the law through faith, but God dropped a way better flex with His Son...and yup, that's all been fulfilled by faith, no cap.
[Ether 12:12] No faith, no miracles...God stays low-key until people actually bring the faith heat, no frontin'.
[Ether 12:13] Peep this: Alma and Amulek's faith was so strong it made the whole prison collapse...straight-up miracle energy.
[Ether 12:14] Facts: Nephi and Lehi's faith flipped the script on the Lamanites, baptizing them with fire and the Holy Ghost...major glow-up.
[Ether 12:15] Check it...Ammon and his crew's faith pulled off a huge miracle with the Lamanites, no cap.
[Ether 12:16] For real, everyone who flexed miracles did it through faith...whether they were pre-Christ or post-Christ, same energy.
[Ether 12:17] The OG three disciples scored the no-death deal through faith, but they had to level up their faith before snagging that promise, facts.
[Ether 12:18] No one's ever pulled miracles without faith first, cuz you gotta believe in the Son of God before you can flex those receipts.
[Ether 12:19] Low-key, tons had such mad faith pre-Christ that they peeped behind the veil IRL, seeing the stuff they only imagined before...and they were hyped about it.
[Ether 12:20] So check it, the brother of Jared had faith so next-level that when God showed His finger, he straight-up saw it...no hiding...'cause he trusted God's word hard enough to get that vision through faith.
[Ether 12:21] After seeing God's finger thanks to his faith promises, the brother of Jared got the full VIP tour...God showed him everything 'cause he couldn't keep him blocked by the veil anymore.
[Ether 12:22] My ancestors locked in the promise by faith that these truths would reach their bros through the Gentiles...so yeah, Jesus Himself gave me the direct order.
[Ether 12:23] I told Him, "Lord, the Gentiles gonna roast us 'cause our writing's weak; You made us strong in faith and speech thanks to the Holy Ghost, but writing? Nah, not so much."
[Ether 12:24] You low-key gave us shaky hands, so our writing's mad limited...def not like the brother of Jared, whose writings were straight fire, too powerful for most humans to even handle.
[Ether 12:25] You made our words hella powerful, so strong we can't even write 'em right; when we try, our flaws show and we trip over how we phrase stuff, making me low-key scared the Gentiles will roast our words hard.
[Ether 12:26] After I said that, the Lord hit me back: "Clowns gonna mock, but they'll catch feels later; my grace got the meek covered so no one can exploit your weak spots."
[Ether 12:27] If people roll up to me, I'll expose their weak spots...gave them that to keep 'em humble; but trust, my grace covers anyone who bows down and has faith, turning their weak into straight-up strong energy.
[Ether 12:28] Watch, I'll reveal the Gentiles' weak spots and show them that faith, hope, and charity pull up to me...the ultimate source of all that's right.
[Ether 12:29] I, Moroni, heard that and felt majorly blessed, saying, "Lord, your justice gonna drop as planned, 'cause I know you move according to how much faith people flex."
[Ether 12:30] The brother of Jared told Mount Zerin to bounce...and it dipped; no faith, no move...so you only flex when people bring that faith energy first.
[Ether 12:31] That's how you showed up to your squad...after they repped faith and spoke your name, you flexed big time and made your presence known.
[Ether 12:32] I also vibe with how you said you got a spot ready for us in your Father's crib, a place stacked with next-level hope; so if we ain't hoping, no inheritance in that dope mansion for us.
[Ether 12:33] And I remember you said you loved the world so hard you low-key died for it, just to bounce back and set up a crib for all humanity.
[Ether 12:34] Now I get that your love for us is straight-up charity; so no charity, no entry to that crib you set up in your Father's mansions.
[Ether 12:35] So yeah, since you said this, I know if the Gentiles lack charity 'cause they're weak, you'll test them, snatch their talent...even what they've got...and hand it to those flexing with way more.
[Ether 12:36] So I hit up the Lord, praying he'd drop some grace on the Gentiles so they could catch those charity vibes.
[Ether 12:37] Then the Lord told me: if they lack charity, that ain't on you...you stayed loyal; so your robes get cleaned up, and since you peeped your weakness, you'll get strong enough to chill in the spot I set up in my Father's crib.
[Ether 12:38] So now, I, Moroni, peace out to the Gentiles and my loved ones, until we all link up at Christ's judgment-seat, where everyone'll see my robes ain't stained with your blood...say less.
[Ether 12:39] Then y'all'll know I've seen Jesus IRL, talked face to face, and he kept it 100 with me like any real homie would, all in my own language about this stuff.
[Ether 12:40] I only dropped a few words here 'cause low-key, my writing skills are kinda sus.
[Ether 12:41] So, I'm telling you to go find this Jesus everyone from the prophets to the apostles raves about, so God's grace, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost...all the ultimate witnesses...can vibe in you forever. Amen.
[Ether 13:1] Alright, it's Moroni back at it, wrapping up my story about how these people I've been spilling tea on got totally wrecked.
[Ether 13:2] So yeah, they totally ghosted all Ether's words, even though he straight-up told them everything from day one; after the flood dipped, this land was prime, the Lord's chosen spot, and He wanted everyone living there to be on His team.
[Ether 13:3] This was the OG spot for the New Jerusalem, set to drop from heaven, the ultimate holy hangout of the Lord.
[Ether 13:4] Ether had the futuristic rizz, peeping the days of Christ and dropping prophecies about a New Jerusalem landing right here on this turf.
[Ether 13:5] He also dropped receipts about Israel's squad and the OG Jerusalem where Lehi came from...after it got wrecked, it'd get rebuilt, no cap, turning back into a holy city for the Lord; not a new Jerusalem 'cause it's old school, but a holy city lifted up again for the house of Israel.
[Ether 13:6] Plus, a New Jerusalem's gonna rise here for the leftover crew of Joseph's fam, and trust, there's been a low-key foreshadowing of this already.
[Ether 13:7] Just like Joseph took his dad to Egypt and passed there, the Lord pulled a remnant of Joseph's fam outta Jerusalem to flex mercy, making sure they didn't ghost forever...same mercy He showed Joseph's dad.
[Ether 13:8] So, the leftover house of Joseph's squad is gonna settle here, this land becoming their legit inheritance; they'll build a holy city for the Lord, just like old-school Jerusalem, and they won't get played or confused again...until the whole earth vibes out at the end.
[Ether 13:9] There's gonna be a fresh new heaven and earth, kinda like the old but upgraded since the old one's ghosted, and everything's rebooted and brand new.
[Ether 13:10] Then New Jerusalem rolls up; mad blessings to those living there, rocking white threads thanks to the Lamb's blood, and they're part of Joseph's leftover crew from Israel's fam.
[Ether 13:11] Then the OG Jerusalem shows back up; its people get mad blessings since they've been cleansed by the Lamb's blood...they're the ones scattered worldwide, pulled in from north and all around, living proof of God's promise to Abraham's crew.
[Ether 13:12] When all this goes down, it flexes the scripture: those who started first end up last, and the last ones snatch the first spot...say less.
[Ether 13:13] I was gonna spill more tea, but nah, forbidden; Ether's prophecies were straight fire, but peeps clowned him, tossed him aside; dude low-key hid in a rock hole by day and went on night patrols, peeping future vibes on the people.
[Ether 13:14] While chilling in that rock hideout, he finished this record, watching the chaos and destruction hit the people...all on his late-night grind.
[Ether 13:15] So, the year Ether got ghosted by his crew, a massive war broke out; lots of big-shot fighters started scheming to take down Coriantumr with their shady plots...yeah, the ones already mentioned.
[Ether 13:16] Coriantumr, being no noob...he schooled himself in all war hacks and global sneaky moves...straight up threw down against those tryna end him.
[Ether 13:17] But nope...Coriantumr and his fly sons and daughters, plus Cohor's and Corihor's crew? No cap, none of their fine kids hit repentance; honestly, not a single one on earth turned from their sins.
[Ether 13:18] So, in the first year Ether was hiding in that rock cave, plenty got shanked by those shady secret combo squads battling Coriantumr to snatch the kingdom.
[Ether 13:19] Coriantumr's sons threw down hard and lost mad blood in the fight.
[Ether 13:20] In year two, the Lord hit up Ether with the word: roll up to Coriantumr and prophecy that if he and his whole squad repent, God's ready to hand over the kingdom and spare the people...bet.
[Ether 13:21] If not, everyone's getting wiped out except maybe Coriantumr...he's just gonna live long enough to watch another crew claim the land, get buried by them, and see every soul erased but him.
[Ether 13:22] Coriantumr, his fam, and peeps didn't hit repentance; the wars kept raging, and they tried to cap Ether, but dude dipped and went back to his rock hideout.
[Ether 13:23] Then Shared popped off, clapped Coriantumr so hard that by year three he had him locked up as a captive.
[Ether 13:24] But in year four, Coriantumr's sons bounced back, smashed Shared, and snagged the kingdom back for their dad.
[Ether 13:25] Straight up, war exploded all over the land...every dude and his crew grinding hard for whatever they wanted.
[Ether 13:26] The place was low-key sus with robbers everywhere, and honestly, wickedness was flexing non-stop across the whole land.
[Ether 13:27] Coriantumr got mad salty at Shared, rolled up with his armies to throw hands; they clashed hard in Gilgal valley, and the fight got straight-up brutal.
[Ether 13:28] Shared held it down for three days straight, but Coriantumr eventually clapped him and chased him all the way to the plains of Heshlon.
[Ether 13:29] Shared bounced back, threw down on the plains, straight-up clapped Coriantumr, and pushed him back to Gilgal valley.
[Ether 13:30] Coriantumr came through again in Gilgal valley, smashed Shared for the last time and ended him, no cap.
[Ether 13:31] Shared got a sneaky shot on Coriantumr's thigh, putting him on pause from beef for two years while everyone else went full savage, spilling blood with zero chill.
[Ether 14:1] The land got cursed big time 'cause everyone was mad wicked...guys would put their gear or sword on the shelf, but next day? Gone. That's how heavy the curse was, no cap.
[Ether 14:2] So everyone clung tight to their stuff, no borrowing or lending vibes; dudes basically kept their sword hilts glued to their right hands to guard their life, fam, and squad.
[Ether 14:3] Two years post-Shared's RIP, his bro stepped up to throw hands with Coriantumr...but Coriantumr clapped him and chased him all the way to Akish wilderness.
[Ether 14:4] Shared's bro threw down with Coriantumr in Akish wilderness, the fight got mad intense, and thousands caught L's by the sword.
[Ether 14:5] Coriantumr tried to lock down the wilderness, but Shared's bro rolled out at night and wrecked part of Coriantumr's army while they were sloppy drunk.
[Ether 14:6] He pulled up in Moron and straight-up took Coriantumr's throne like a boss.
[Ether 14:7] Coriantumr and his squad camped in the wilderness for two years, flexing and powering up their army big time.
[Ether 14:8] Gilead, Shared's bro, also leveled up his army hardcore thanks to some lowkey secret combos.
[Ether 14:9] Then his own high priest straight-up iced him while he was chillin' on his throne...major betrayal vibes.
[Ether 14:10] Lowkey, one of those secret combos killed him in a hidden spot, snagged the kingdom, and his name was Lib...big dude, literally tallest guy in the land.
[Ether 14:11] Year one of Lib's reign, Coriantumr rolled up to Moron and threw down against Lib.
[Ether 14:12] They threw hands and Lib smacked Coriantumr's arm leaving him busted, but Coriantumr's squad pushed so hard Lib dipped to the coast borders.
[Ether 14:13] Coriantumr chased him down, and Lib said "bet" and threw down right on the seashore.
[Ether 14:14] Lib clapped Coriantumr's army so hard they bounced back to the Akish wilderness...big L for them.
[Ether 14:15] Lib kept chasing Coriantumr all the way to Agosh plains, where Coriantumr dipped with his whole crew, running from Lib in that part of the land.
[Ether 14:16] At Agosh plains, Coriantumr clapped Lib till he died, but Lib's bro jumped in to throw hands, making the fight hella intense, and Coriantumr had to dip again from Lib's brother's army.
[Ether 14:17] Lib's brother Shiz was his name, and he went full savage chasing Coriantumr, wrecking cities, killing women and kids, and straight-up torching the places.
[Ether 14:18] Fear of Shiz was spreading like wildfire everywhere; everyone was like, "Who can flex against Shiz's army? Dude's just wiping the floor with the whole land!"
[Ether 14:19] People started squad up in armies all over the land, ready to throw down everywhere.
[Ether 14:20] The crowd split up...some dipped to roll with Shiz's crew, others bounced to back Coriantumr's squad.
[Ether 14:21] The war dragged on mad long with bloodbath after bloodbath, leaving the whole land straight-up carpeted with dead bodies...no cap.
[Ether 14:22] The war moved hella fast...no time for burial, just bloodshed on bloodshed, leaving dead men, women, and kids strewn everywhere, turning into worm chow.
[Ether 14:23] The stench of dead bodies was everywhere across the land, making folks low-key stressed 24/7 from the nasty vibe.
[Ether 14:24] Still, Shiz stayed on Coriantumr's tail, swearing revenge for his dead bro, but Ether had the Lord's tea that Coriantumr wouldn't catch the sword's L.
[Ether 14:25] So yeah, the Lord pulled up with full wrath mode, and their nasty sins basically paved the way for their eternal wipeout...no cap.
[Ether 14:26] Shiz chased Coriantumr east all the way to the ocean's edge, where they threw down in battle for three straight days, no chill.
[Ether 14:27] Shiz's army got wrecked so bad people started vibing scared, dipping from Coriantumr's forces, then rollin' into Corihor's land and snatching up anyone who wasn't down with them.
[Ether 14:28] They set up camp in Corihor's valley, while Coriantumr camped in Shurr's valley near hill Comnor. Then Coriantumr flexed his troops on hill Comnor and blew a trumpet, basically sending a "battle? say less" invite to Shiz's army.
[Ether 14:29] They rolled up, got clapped, tried again, got clapped again, then came back a third time...this fight went full savage real quick.
[Ether 14:30] Shiz landed some heavy hits on Coriantumr, leaving him deep cut and bleeding out, so dude passed out cold, looking like he was ghosting IRL.
[Ether 14:31] The body count on both sides was insane...men, women, kids all wrecked...so Shiz told his squad to stop chasing Coriantumr's army and just bounce back to camp.
[Ether 15:1] Once Coriantumr patched himself up, he started recalling the legit words Ether dropped on him earlier.
[Ether 15:2] Coriantumr peeped that almost two million of his squad were dead by the sword, and low-key his heart broke...mighty men, their wives, kids, all taken out.
[Ether 15:3] He started regretting all the bad moves he made, remembered the prophets' word receipts were spot on so far, and his soul was straight-up mourning with zero comfort vibes.
[Ether 15:4] He slid into Shiz's inbox with a letter begging him to chill and save the people, even offering to drop the throne for their sake.
[Ether 15:5] When Shiz got the message, he fired back a letter saying if Coriantumr handed himself over, Shiz would slay him personally but let the people live.
[Ether 15:6] The people stayed mad sus and didn't fix their ways; Coriantumr's crew got heated at Shiz's squad and vice versa, so Shiz's people threw down on Coriantumr's.
[Ether 15:7] When Coriantumr peeped he was about to L, he bounced fast, running from Shiz's crew once more.
[Ether 15:8] Coriantumr pulled up at the massive Ripliancum waters...basically the biggest flex spot...set up camp, Shiz pitched right next door, and next day it was battle time, say less.
[Ether 15:9] They threw down in a brutal fight, Coriantumr got hurt again, and dude straight-up passed out from losing mad blood.
[Ether 15:10] Coriantumr's squad went hard on Shiz's crew, crushed them so bad they bounced south and set up camp at this spot called Ogath.
[Ether 15:11] Coriantumr's army camped by hill Ramah...the exact spot where my dad Mormon stashed the sacred records for the Lord, no cap.
[Ether 15:12] They rounded up every survivor left on the land...everyone but Ether himself, who was still breathing.
[Ether 15:13] Ether watched the whole scene and saw Coriantumr's fans squad up with his army, and Shiz's supporters do the same on their side.
[Ether 15:14] So for four straight years, they were grinding, pulling in every soul on the land to stack their squads with max power, no cap.
[Ether 15:15] Once everyone rolled deep...men, women, kids, all strapped with shields, breastplates, helmets, rocking war fit...they marched and brawled all day long, but neither squad caught the W.
[Ether 15:16] When night hit, they were wiped, bounced to their camps, then started straight-up howling and grieving over their fallen homies so loud it shook the air hard.
[Ether 15:17] Next day they clashed again, a savage and brutal fight, still no L's for either side; come night, the air got wrecked with their cries and sob stories for their fallen squad.
[Ether 15:18] Coriantumr slid into Shiz's DMs with an epistle saying, "Yo, chill on the battles, take the throne, and spare everyone's lives...say less."
[Ether 15:19] But fr, the Lord dipped from the struggle, Satan took full control of the people's hearts...they were so stubborn and blind-minded they basically signed up for self-destruction and jumped back into the fight.
[Ether 15:20] They threw down all day, and when night fell, they crashed right there on their swords...no cap, total warzone vibes.
[Ether 15:21] Next day, they went full beast mode, battling nonstop till night dropped again.
[Ether 15:22] When night came, they were straight-up wasted on rage like a dude smashed on wine; then crashed again right on their swords.
[Ether 15:23] Next day, they threw down once more; by night, almost everyone was down by the sword except 52 of Coriantumr's crew and 69 of Shiz's squad.
[Ether 15:24] That night they crashed on their swords again, and next day went all in...swords clashing, shields popping, grinding hard all day long.
[Ether 15:25] When night rolled in, only 32 of Shiz's squad and 27 of Coriantumr's crew were still standing.
[Ether 15:26] They ate, crashed, and braced for death tomorrow...big beasts, no cap, absolute units in strength.
[Ether 15:27] They went at it hard for three hours straight, then finally crashed from blood loss, totally wiped out.
[Ether 15:28] When Coriantumr's squad got enough juice to move, they tried to bounce for their lives, but Shiz popped up with his crew, swearing in pure rage he'd either take Coriantumr out or die trying...no cap.
[Ether 15:29] So Shiz chased them down, caught up next day, and they threw down again; everyone went down except Coriantumr and Shiz, but Shiz was straight-up out cold from blood loss.
[Ether 15:30] Coriantumr, leaning on his sword for a sec to catch his breath, then straight-up clapped Shiz by chopping off his head.
[Ether 15:31] After Coriantumr chopped Shiz's head, Shiz somehow pushed up on his hands, then crashed, gasping for air before finally ghosting for good.
[Ether 15:32] Coriantumr then dropped flat on the ground, looking dead as hell like he'd left this vibe behind.
[Ether 15:33] God hit up Ether saying "Go check it out," so Ether rolled out and saw God's words were fully on point; he wrapped up his record (didn't spill a hundredth part tho) and low-key stashed it so Limhi's crew could flex on it later.
[Ether 15:34] Ether's final flex: Don't matter if God's got me translated or I gotta grind through flesh pain, as long as I secure that spot in God's kingdom. Amen.
[Moroni 1:1] So yeah, I'm Moroni, done clipping the Jaredite story, thought I was done, but I'm still breathing; low-key staying ghost with the Lamanites so they don't cap me.
[Moroni 1:2] Their beefs? Straight savage. They're murdering any Nephite who won't throw shade at Christ...mad sus energy, no cap.
[Moroni 1:3] Me, Moroni, I'm not about to cancel Christ; so I low-key ghost wherever I can just to keep breathing.
[Moroni 1:4] So yeah, I'm dropping a few more lines even though I thought I was done...maybe they'll slap for my Lamanite fam someday, if it's God's call.
[Moroni 2:1] Straight from Christ's mouth to his chosen twelve disciples when he laid hands on them, no cap.
[Moroni 2:2] He called them out by name, saying: Hit up the Father in my name with some serious prayer energy; then, after that, when you lay hands on someone, you'll flex the Holy Ghost on 'em...in my name too...'cause that's how my apostles roll.
[Moroni 2:3] Christ dropped these words during his first show-up; the crowd was totally snoozing, but the disciples caught the vibe...and the Holy Ghost landed on everyone they laid hands on.
[Moroni 3:1] How the disciples...aka the church elders...went about ordaining priests and teachers, no cap.
[Moroni 3:2] After hitting up the Father in Christ's name with some prayer, they laid hands on 'em and said:
[Moroni 3:3] In Jesus Christ's name, I'm ordaining you as priest...or teacher if that's your vibe...to preach repentance and forgiveness through Jesus, sticking with faith in his name till the end. Amen.
[Moroni 3:4] This is how they ordained priests and teachers...based on God's gifts and callings...with the Holy Ghost's power flexing through them.
[Moroni 4:1] How elders and priests served Christ's flesh and blood to the church, sticking to Christ's commandments...so we know the vibes are legit; the elder or priest was the one serving it up.
[Moroni 4:2] They all knelt with the church and hit up the Father in Christ's name, saying:
[Moroni 4:3] Yo God, Eternal Father, we ask in Jesus' name to bless and set apart this bread for anyone who eats it...so they remember your Son's body, flex their commitment to his name, keep his commands, and stay plugged into his Spirit forever. Amen.
[Moroni 5:1] How they handed out the wine...so they grabbed the cup and said:
[Moroni 5:2] So they prayed: God, Eternal Father, in Jesus' name, bless and set apart this wine for everyone who drinks it...let it remind them of your Son's blood shed for them, keeping them woke on him and locked in with his Spirit. Amen.
[Moroni 6:1] Now about baptism: elders, priests, and teachers got dunked only after proving they had the right fruit to flex their worthiness.
[Moroni 6:2] No one got baptized unless they showed up with a broken heart, humble spirit, and receipts proving real repentance to the church.
[Moroni 6:3] Nobody got baptized unless they claimed Christ's name and were dead set on serving him till the end.
[Moroni 6:4] Once baptized and cleansed by the Holy Ghost's power, they joined Christ's crew; their names got logged so they'd be remembered, fed good words, stay on the right grind, keep prayer on lock, and trust only in Christ's merit...the OG and finisher of their faith.
[Moroni 6:5] The church squad met up all the time to fast, pray, and vibe-check each other's soul health.
[Moroni 6:6] They gathered regularly to eat bread and sip wine, always remembering the Lord Jesus.
[Moroni 6:7] They ran a tight ship...no cap on sin allowed; if someone slipped, three church witnesses called them out to the elders, and if no confession or repentance followed, their names got wiped from Christ's squad.
[Moroni 6:8] But anytime they truly repented and came through for forgiveness with real talk, they got the W and were forgiven.
[Moroni 6:9] Their church hangs ran on the Spirit's vibes and Holy Ghost's power, leading the crew when to preach, hype, pray, plead, or sing...whatever the Holy Ghost flexed was the move.
[Moroni 7:1] So yeah, I'm Moroni dropping some words from my dad Mormon about faith, hope, and charity...he schooled the squad like this in their synagogue hangout spot.
[Moroni 7:2] Yo, it's Mormon speaking to my beloved fam; no cap, by God the Father's grace, Jesus's will, and my calling, I'm allowed to hit you up right now.
[Moroni 7:3] So basically, I'm talking to the church homies who're chill followers of Christ and got that solid hope to vibe in the Lord's rest now and forever in heaven.
[Moroni 7:4] Low-key judging y'all, fam, 'cause you're out here walking peaceful with the rest of humanity.
[Moroni 7:5] I remember God's word: you'll know peeps by their actions...good vibes in, good vibes out, no cap.
[Moroni 7:6] Facts: God said a bad dude can't pull off true good; even if he throws a gift or prays, without real intent, it's straight-up useless.
[Moroni 7:7] That kind of fake flex ain't gonna count as righteousness, no cap.
[Moroni 7:8] If an evil dude gifts but does it all salty and grudgy, it's like he ain't gifted at all...God still sees him as straight-up evil.
[Moroni 7:9] Same deal if a guy prays without real heart...it's all cap, no gain, 'cause God don't vibe with that fake energy.
[Moroni 7:10] Bottom line: an evil dude can't pull off legit good or drop a solid gift, period.
[Moroni 7:11] Real talk: a bitter spring won't spill good water, and a good spring won't drip bitter; so a devil's servant can't roll with Christ, and if they do, they can't serve the devil.
[Moroni 7:12] So, all good stuff rolls from God, and evil's straight from the devil...He's God's enemy, always beefing, hyping sin, and pushing evil moves nonstop.
[Moroni 7:13] But peep this: anything pushing you to do good, love God, and serve Him? That's pure God inspo, no cap.
[Moroni 7:14] So listen up, fam: don't get it twisted...don't say evil's from God or good-and-God's stuff is devil vibes.
[Moroni 7:15] Yo, fam, y'all got the power to judge and spot good vs evil ... it's mad obvious, like daytime vs straight-up night, no cap.
[Moroni 7:16] The Spirit of Christ is plugged into everyone so they can peep good vs evil; if something pushes you to do good and believe in Christ, that's straight-up Christ's signal ... no cap, it's God's move.
[Moroni 7:17] But anything pushing folks to do evil, ditch Christ, and ghost God? Deadass, that's devil energy...he and his squad don't convince anyone to do good, no cap.
[Moroni 7:18] Alright fam, since y'all got Christ's light to judge right, don't flop and judge wrong ... 'cause the vibes you send out come right back atcha.
[Moroni 7:19] So I'm begging y'all, delve deep in Christ's light to spot good from evil; grab every L/W good vibe and don't hate on it, and you're basically rocking that Christ kid energy.
[Moroni 7:20] So, fam, real talk...how can y'all seriously clutch every good thing out there?
[Moroni 7:21] Now we're hitting faith...the move I promised...lemme show you how to snag every good thing out here.
[Moroni 7:22] Look, God's OG from forever to forever, sent angels to drop tea on Christ's arrival; and in Christ, all the good vibes come through.
[Moroni 7:23] Plus, God straight-up told the prophets Himself that Christ was on His way...no cap.
[Moroni 7:24] God flexed different ways to show good stuff to humans, and all good things come straight from Christ; otherwise, we'd be pure chaos with zero good vibes.
[Moroni 7:25] So angels doing their thing and God's own words got people hyped on faith in Christ; and with that faith, they grabbed every good thing...kept that energy till Christ showed up.
[Moroni 7:26] When Christ rolled up, folks got saved by faith in His name and leveled up to God's kids; no cap, Christ said to our ancestors, if you ask the Father in His name, believe you'll get that good stuff, and boom...it's done.
[Moroni 7:27] So, my fam, did miracles stop just 'cause Christ bounced to heaven and chilled at God's right hand, claiming mercy rights for us? Say less, that ain't how it works.
[Moroni 7:28] Christ nailed the law, claims everyone with faith in Him; believers stick to every good vibe, He's their hype man forever, living large in heaven.
[Moroni 7:29] Since He did all that, fam, you think miracles ghosted? Nah, and angels kept flexing, still serving humans on the reg.
[Moroni 7:30] They're all about Him, doing His bidding, showing up to the solid faith crew with unwavering vibes in every type of godly hustle.
[Moroni 7:31] Their gig? Roasting folks into repentance and grinding the Father's covenants, prepping the scene by dropping Christ's word to God's chosen crew so they can flex their testimony.
[Moroni 7:32] By doing this, God sets the stage for the rest to catch faith in Christ, letting the Holy Ghost chill in their hearts with full power; that's how the Father flexes His covenants to us.
[Moroni 7:33] Christ said straight up: if you flex faith in Me, you'll get the power to handle whatever's clutch for Me.
[Moroni 7:34] He said: Repent, every corner of the earth, roll up to Me, get baptized in my name, and flex faith in Me to snag salvation.
[Moroni 7:35] So, fam, if what I'm spilling is facts, and God proves it with big power and glory on the last day, then tell me...did the era of miracles really dip?
[Moroni 7:36] Did angels stop sliding up to people? Did God ghost the Holy Ghost's power? Nah fam, as long as time's ticking, Earth's standing, and there's even one soul to save, He's got us.
[Moroni 7:37] Nah fam, miracles pop off by faith, angels show up and serve 'cause of faith; if all this stopped, it'd be on us humans 'cause of lack of belief...and then everything's just straight-up pointless.
[Moroni 7:38] No cap, no one gets saved without faith in Christ's name; so if miracles dipped, faith dipped too, and humans would be stuck like redemption never even happened...big L energy.
[Moroni 7:39] But yo, fam, I'm betting on you...your humble vibes show you got faith in Christ; if not, then sorry, you're not even on the guest list for His squad.
[Moroni 7:40] Also, fam, let's talk hope...how you gonna catch faith if you ain't got some hope in your corner? Say less.
[Moroni 7:41] So what's the hope? Straight up, hope comes thru Christ's atonement and resurrection power...rising up to eternal life...bet on that 'cause of your faith in Him, no cap.
[Moroni 7:42] So if you got faith, hope's a must; no faith means no hope...facts only.
[Moroni 7:43] Real talk: no faith or hope if you ain't humble and chill in your heart.
[Moroni 7:44] If not humble, faith and hope are just vibes, 'cause God's only about the meek; if you're chill in heart and admit Jesus is Christ through the Holy Ghost's power, then charity's gotta be your main move...no charity means you're ghost, so no cap, you need that charity.
[Moroni 7:45] Charity's got mad patience, stays kind, doesn't flex or get jelly, doesn't chase clout, doesn't snap easily, keeps no bad vibes, claps for truth not drama, holds it down through everything, trusts, hopes, and straight-up endures all.
[Moroni 7:46] So listen up, fam, no charity means you're basically ghost; charity never drops the ball...stick to it hard, 'cause everything else eventually tanks.
[Moroni 7:47] Charity is straight-up Christ's pure love, built to last forever; anyone rocking it on Judgment Day is gonna be all good, no cap.
[Moroni 7:48] So fam, pray hard to the Father, heart-on-fire style, asking to be filled with this mad love He drops on all who're legit followers of Jesus; that we become God's own, ready to flex like Him when He shows up, seeing Him real, holding onto that hope, and leveling up pure like Him. Amen.
[Moroni 8:1] Here's a letter from my dad Mormon, sent to me Moroni right after I got the ministry gig; he kicked it off like this:
[Moroni 8:2] Yo Moroni, my beloved son, I'm hyped that Jesus Christ's been watching out for you and tapped you for His ministry and sacred grind.
[Moroni 8:3] I'm always on you in my prayers, nonstop hitting up God the Father in Jesus' name, hoping His endless grace keeps you strong in faith till the very end.
[Moroni 8:4] Yo son, gotta speak on what's mad heavy on me...it sucks that y'all are catching beef and drama.
[Moroni 8:5] From what I peeped, y'all been beefin' over whether to baptize the little kids.
[Moroni 8:6] So, son, grind hard to kill this big mistake in your crew...that's why I'm dropping you this letter.
[Moroni 8:7] As soon as I caught wind of this, I hit up the Lord for the 411, and His word dropped on me through the Holy Ghost's power like a fire mixtape:
[Moroni 8:8] Peep Christ's words, your Redeemer and Lord: He didn't come to call the righteous, but the sinners to repent; the healthy don't need doctors, only the sick; kids are pure...they can't sin...so Adam's curse got ghosted in me, and circumcision law is canceled too.
[Moroni 8:9] The Holy Ghost dropped this truth on me clear: so, my beloved son, baptizing little kids is straight-up disrespect for God...big-time mockery, no cap.
[Moroni 8:10] Listen up: teach repentance and baptism to those who are old enough to sin; tell parents to repent, get baptized, and stay humble like their kids...then everyone gets saved, whole squad.
[Moroni 8:11] Little kids don't need to repent or get baptized; baptism's for repentance and keeping commandments so sins get wiped clean.
[Moroni 8:12] But kids have been alive in Christ since OG times; if not, God's gotta be sus...playing favorites, switching up, and that ain't the vibe...'cause tons of kids died no-baptism, no cap.
[Moroni 8:13] So if kids needed baptism to be saved, they'd all be stuck in endless hell...and that energy's straight-up wrong.
[Moroni 8:14] Low-key, anyone thinking kids need baptism is deep in bitterness and sin's chains, lacking faith, hope, and love; if they die stuck on that mindset, hell's their final stop, no cap.
[Moroni 8:15] It's straight-up savage to think God saves one kid just 'cause of baptism while letting another flop 'cause they didn't get dunked.
[Moroni 8:16] Big L for anyone twisting God's ways like this...they're doomed unless they repent; I'm speaking facts with God's authority, zero fear of humans 'cause perfect love claps back at all fear.
[Moroni 8:17] I'm packed with charity...that forever kind of love...so all kids flex the same in my eyes; I love 'em all perfectly, and they're all in on that salvation drip.
[Moroni 8:18] Fact: God's no cap...He ain't playing favorites or switching sides; He stays 100% unchangeable from forever to forever.
[Moroni 8:19] Kids can't repent, so denying God's pure mercy to them? That's straight-up evil... they're alive in Him purely 'cause of that mercy, no cap.
[Moroni 8:20] Anyone saying kids need baptism basically denies Christ's mercy and throws shade on His atonement and redemption power...big disrespect, no cap.
[Moroni 8:21] Big warning to those clowns...they're risking death, hell, and eternal pain. I'm saying this loud and clear 'cause God's got my back. Pay attention, or they'll be your worst enemies at Christ's final court.
[Moroni 8:22] Look, all kids and those without the law are alive in Christ; redemption power hits those with no law, so if you ain't condemned, you can't repent, and baptism ain't doing squat for you.
[Moroni 8:23] But low-key, denying Christ's mercy and the Holy Spirit's power while flexing on dead works is straight-up mocking God, no cap.
[Moroni 8:24] Yo son, this don't make sense...repentance is for those caught in condemnation and stuck under the curse of a broken law, say less.
[Moroni 8:25] First step of repentance? Baptism, no cap. Baptism comes through faith when you're grinding on commandments, and that hustle wipes your sins clean.
[Moroni 8:26] When your sins get wiped, you catch that meek and humble vibe; that vibe invites the Holy Ghost to roll through, bringing hope and perfect love that sticks if you keep grinding in prayer till the end when all saints link up with God.
[Moroni 8:27] Yo son, if I don't bounce soon to face the Lamanites, I'll hit you up again...this Nephite crew's pride is basically their own death sentence unless they get woke and repent.
[Moroni 8:28] Pray for them, son, so they catch that repentance vibe. But low-key, I'm worried the Spirit's done trying with them...they're out here trying to cancel all God-given power and straight-up denying the Holy Ghost.
[Moroni 8:29] After ghosting such major knowledge, my son, they're about to get wrecked, making all the prophets' and Savior's predictions come true, no cap.
[Moroni 8:30] Peace out, my son, till I slide into your messages again or we cross paths IRL. Amen.
[Moroni 9:1] Yo beloved son, just hitting you up again so you know I'm still breathing, but gotta spill some heavy, low-key sad stuff.
[Moroni 9:2] Straight up, I caught a nasty fight with the Lamanites and we didn't snatch the W; Archeantus, Luram, and Emron got taken out by the sword, plus we lost mad of our best warriors.
[Moroni 9:3] Yo son, low-key scared the Lamanites are gonna wipe us out since these folks ain't repenting and Satan's out here hyping nonstop beef between them.
[Moroni 9:4] I'm grinding nonstop with them, but when I hit 'em hard with God's word they get all shook and salty; when I chill, they just block it...fr, I'm worried the Spirit's given up on them.
[Moroni 9:5] They're so mad it's like death's no flex to them; they straight lost all love for each other and are always thirsty for blood and revenge, no chill.
[Moroni 9:6] So, my beloved son, even with their tough vibes, we gotta grind hard; quitting means getting ratioed in judgment, 'cause this clay suit demands we slay the enemy of all good and chill with God's squad forever.
[Moroni 9:7] Now I gotta spill some tea on this people's pain...heard from Amoron that the Lamanites snatched hella prisoners from Sherrizah's tower, men, women, and kids all caught up in that mess.
[Moroni 9:8] The Lamanites slaughtered the husbands and dads, then straight fed the women their husbands' meat and the kids their dads', barely giving them any water...mad savage, no cap.
[Moroni 9:9] Even with the Lamanites' savage acts, Moriantum's crew ain't innocent; they snatched tons of Lamanite daughters and straight robbed them of their most sacred flex...chastity and virtue.
[Moroni 9:10] After wrecking them like that, they murdered those girls brutal AF, torturing them to death, then ate their flesh like wild beasts...heart cold as ice...and flexed it as some twisted bravery badge.
[Moroni 9:11] Yo my beloved son, how tf can a squad this savage even call themselves civilized...straight up chaos.
[Moroni 9:12] Like, just a few years ago, they were low-key chill and a straight-up delightsome crew.
[Moroni 9:13] But fr, my son, how does a people vibing hard on this level of abomination even exist?
[Moroni 9:14] Like, seriously, how do we think God's just gonna chill and hold back on judging us for this mess?
[Moroni 9:15] Yo, my heart's straight crying: Woe to this squad. God, come judge 'em and low-key cover up their sins and nasty deeds from your sight!
[Moroni 9:16] Also, my son, tons of widows and their daughters are stuck in Sherrizah; whatever scraps the Lamanites didn't snatch, Zenephi's army grabbed, leaving them to roam hungry AF...old ladies dropping dead on the grind.
[Moroni 9:17] My army's weak sauce, Lamanite forces squad up between me and Sherrizah, and anyone who dipped to Aaron's crew just got clapped by their brutal vibes.
[Moroni 9:18] Damn, my people are straight-up depraved...no order, zero mercy. I'm just a dude with regular strength, and honestly, I can't keep bossing them around no more.
[Moroni 9:19] They're mad strong in their perv vibes, ruthless AF, no cap...old or young, no one's safe. They hype everything but good stuff, and the pain our women and kids catch across this land? Beyond words, no receipts can even capture it.
[Moroni 9:20] Alright, my son, I'm done dwelling on this nightmare. You know these people's wickedness...they're straight up heartless, no morals, and way worse than the Lamanites, no cap.
[Moroni 9:21] Look, my son, I can't even put in a good word for them to God without risking getting smacked myself.
[Moroni 9:22] But yo, my son, I'm hyping you up to God and banking on Christ to save you; I'm praying God keeps you alive to see either His people bounce back or get totally wiped...'cause they're doomed if they don't repent and turn back.
[Moroni 9:23] If they go down, it'll be like the Jaredites...straight-up self-sabotage from stubborn hearts chasing blood and revenge, no chill.
[Moroni 9:24] If they do go down, we know a bunch of our bros already flipped to the Lamanites and more will too; so if you survive and I don't, jot down some stuff...but I'm hoping to see you soon 'cause I got sacred records to pass on.
[Moroni 9:25] My son, stay loyal to Christ; don't let my words drag you into a deep sad, but let Christ lift you up...remember his sufferings, death, showing himself to our ancestors, his mad mercy and patience, and the hype of eternal life stay on your brain forever.
[Moroni 9:26] May the mad grace of God the Father, chilling on His heavenly throne, and our Lord Jesus Christ, flexing at the right hand of power till everything bows to Him, vibe with you forever. Amen.
[Moroni 10:1] So, I Moroni'm dropping some real talk for my Lamanite fam...they need to know it's been over 420 years since that sign dropped about Christ's arrival, no cap.
[Moroni 10:2] I'm sealin' these records tight after dropping some last words to hype you up, say less.
[Moroni 10:3] Yo, when you read this...if God's cool with you reading it...remember how clutch the Lord's been to humanity since Adam's day, and let that marinate in your heart.
[Moroni 10:4] When you get this, I'm saying hit up God, the Eternal Father, in Christ's name...ask straight up if this is true; if you're real with heart and faith, the Holy Ghost will slide in and show you the receipts.
[Moroni 10:5] Low-key, the Holy Ghost's power is your plug to know the truth about everything, no cap.
[Moroni 10:6] Anything good is straight-up just and true; so no good vibe ever denies Christ...actually, it's out here confirming He's real.
[Moroni 10:7] You'll know He's real through the Holy Ghost's power; so don't sleep on God's power...He's flexing through faith like yesterday, today, and always.
[Moroni 10:8] Yo, don't front on God's gifts...they're mad diverse but all from the same God. He runs the show, dropping these through the Spirit to hook people up.
[Moroni 10:9] Check it, the Spirit of God blesses some to drop knowledge packed with wisdom.
[Moroni 10:10] And to another, the Spirit hands the vibe to school folks in straight-up knowledge.
[Moroni 10:11] Some get mad faith, others snag healing powers...all powered by that same Spirit energy.
[Moroni 10:12] Then there's those who flex with straight-up miracle moves, no cap.
[Moroni 10:13] Plus, some get the plug to prophecy about everything on deck.
[Moroni 10:14] And others catch the vibe to see angels and those spiritual homies on the mission.
[Moroni 10:15] Then some get mad skills speaking all kinds of tongues, no cap.
[Moroni 10:16] And others get the cheat code to decode languages and all those wild tongues.
[Moroni 10:17] All these gifts drop via the Spirit of Christ, handed out to each person how He vibes.
[Moroni 10:18] Real talk, fam...remember every legit blessing comes straight from Christ, no cap.
[Moroni 10:19] Yo, don't forget Christ's the same OG yesterday, today, and forever; these spiritual gifts won't ghost as long as the world spins...unless people's unbelief vibes too sus.
[Moroni 10:20] So, faith's gotta be in the mix; if faith's there, hope slides in; and where hope's at, charity's gotta show up too...say less.
[Moroni 10:21] No cap, without charity you ain't making it to God's kingdom; no faith, no entry; no hope, also no save.
[Moroni 10:22] If hope dips, despair's gotta roll up, and despair pulls up 'cause of iniquity messing the vibe.
[Moroni 10:23] Christ straight up told our ancestors: with faith, you can flex all the moves that line up with me.
[Moroni 10:24] Yo, I'm talking worldwide...if God's power and gifts ever dip out on y'all, it's 'cause y'all caught that unbelief L.
[Moroni 10:25] Big oof to humanity if that happens; zero good deeds, not even one. But if someone does good, they're flexing God's power and gifts, no cap.
[Moroni 10:26] Big yikes on anyone who ditches these gifts and then bounces...dying stuck in their sins, no save in God's kingdom; I'm quoting Christ here, no cap, not flexing.
[Moroni 10:27] I'm urging y'all to remember this...time's coming fast when you'll see I ain't cap; you'll face God's judgment, and He'll be like, "Didn't I drop these words through this dude like a ghost texting from the grave, straight outta dust?"
[Moroni 10:28] I'm spilling this to flex prophecy receipts; watch, God's eternal voice gonna keep spittin' truth, passing down the vibe from gen to gen, no cap.
[Moroni 10:29] God's gonna prove straight up that what I wrote is 100% facts, no sus.
[Moroni 10:30] Again, I'm telling y'all to pull up to Christ, snag every good gift, and don't even vibe with the sketchy or dirty stuff.
[Moroni 10:31] Rise up from the dirt, Jerusalem...flex those fresh fits, daughter of Zion; beef up your boundaries and level up forever so you don't get played, 'cause the Eternal Father's promises to you, house of Israel, gotta hit.
[Moroni 10:32] Bet, slide up to Christ and level up in Him by ghosting all the ungodly vibes; if you deny that and love God full throttle...mind, heart, and hustle...His grace got you covered to be perfect in Christ, and if you're perfect by His grace, denying God's power ain't even an option.
[Moroni 10:33] Plus, if you're perfect in Christ by God's grace and don't ghost His power, then you're legit sanctified through Christ's blood in the Father's covenant...your sins get wiped, leaving you spotless and holy, no cap.
[Moroni 10:34] Alright fam, peace out...I'm about to crash in God's paradise till my soul and body link up again, then I'll flex through the air to meet y'all at Jehovah's lit courtroom, the Eternal Judge of the living and the dead. Amen.
