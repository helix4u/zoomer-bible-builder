[1 Corinthians 15:11] Okay, so like, either me or them are dropping the truth, and you guys are actually vibing with it.
[1 Corinthians 15:12] If people are still saying Jesus rose from the dead, like, *no cap*, then they're straight-up wrong.
[1 Corinthians 15:13] If there's no comeback, like, no resurrection thing, then Jesus didn't actually rise from the dead ... say less.
[1 Corinthians 15:14] If Jesus didn't bounce back, all this preachin' would be straight-up cap, and our faith would be totally sus.
[1 Corinthians 15:15] Say less… we're straight-up gaslighting God if we claim Jesus rose from the dead, and if the dead don't bounce, then it's a total L.
[1 Corinthians 15:16] If the dead don't bounce back, then like, no cap, Christ didn't resurrect ... it's a total L.
[1 Corinthians 15:17] If Christ didn't bounce back, your whole faith is a L… you're still stuck in the mud.
[1 Corinthians 15:18] Okay, so like, those who passed away in Christ are straight up donezo.
[1 Corinthians 15:19] Low-key sad if it's just this life… being a Christian is the only way to avoid being totally ratioed.
